In general, failuers, defined that way by society, lack many things that successful peopledo n't.
In this harsh environement, to keep with the idea of equality, I am recalling something someone once said to me.
It's good for relacks and sleep.

Over two weeks, we've studied 'Hiragana' and 'gatakana', which are like Japanese alpabets.
I've already found it really hard but I studied the things we worked on in class today for two hours by myself and if I study Japanese continually, I believe that one day I will be albe to write a diary on here in Japanese and be able to speak it!
Every word is pronounced to improve your listenig and pronunciation, and for memorizing, you can learn by three ways, first, by choosing the correct answer out of the three Japanese meanings, second, from three English spellings, finally, choosing the alphabets for the correct English spelling.

I was born in Xi 'an which is widely known as one of the oldest cities around the world, as many as 13 dynesties chose Xi' an as the capital city, which maks me proud.
Just several decades ago, rivers were completely availiable for swimming and fishing.
Now if I am qualified to change one thing here, I would love to chang the enviroment here.
Xi 'an had experienced a really rapid industrial development during last 30 years. People's meterial demand have been highly satisfied.
Nowadays, when people don't have to worry about their livelihood, they unanimously find the enviroment here is much worse than they have imagined.
We have extremly hot summer, unbearable winter, dusty spring and gloomy autumn.
Currently if we keep doing this, undoubtfully this city will be turned into a place where no longer suitable for people to live, sequntially economic achievements will vanish into the air.
Once I'm fortunate enough to be qualified to change enviroment here, shutting unefficient factories, pouring money into improving air and water quality, vigorously encouraging enviroment conservative companies, cultivating enviromental conscience among youngsters will firstly be done.
I knew thier host family has some problems, like they never clearn their rooms, host mother doesn't work, doesn't pay for the bills, and she asked themfor some money to buy food, and so on.

It's like when visiting a Japanese restaurant in Eurrope. The foods there tastes like Japanese food, but there's always be somthing that holds me back from calling it 'Japanese food'.
Maybe it's because the ingredients are not really the same even when I'm following the exact recipe from a website or a cook-book. Onions available in Japane are not the same as the ones in (from) Spain, of-course.

One of my classmates from college already got married last year. I feel a little surprised becase it's only been two years since graduation and it's possible that their finacial condition is not good enough for raising a family.
But maybe my thinking is wrong. Each couple that decides to marry has probably already thought it through to have finaly made such a hard decision. After getting married, they might have many problems that before could not have been imagined. Sometimes it will be difficult to get through it, but if two people love each other enough, they will finally solve the problem.
But everytime time this thought comes to my mind, I realize I would do just the same thing as them.

I'm searching for the most effective way to buld up my vocabulary.
while reading, if you encouner an unknown word, you guess the meaning and read ahead.
Even if you don't fully understand it, it doesn't matter becasue you will see the word somewhere else in a different context.
With this way, you have to look up in the dicitionary every time you encounter an unknown word.
They can't read anything without a dictionary because they are begginers.
last but not least, you should carefully pick what to read for your vocabulry buliding.

Tokyo has a many restrant where you can eat a delicious lunch.

But she doesn't clean the kichen after using plates or the frying pan etc.
So the other flatmates began to grow impatiant.
First, the only Japanese actor, ``Sanada``, who played the capatin of the spaceship, died first and unnaturally.
Second, I saw a monster sneak into the spaceship and kill the crews in the latter half, but I don't get why the preddecessor captain could survive to turn into a monster and kill the new crew.
The first half of the story was really overwhelming and the advent of the monster changed the taste of the whole movie, I thougt.
then I had a lunch that consisted of INARI ZUSHI and mashroom salad.
I was not tired becasue I took a nap.

Some of you might know that if you go overseas or make a foreign friend, it's a good thing to have knowlede about your own country's tradition because some people are interested in Japanese clture.
It's a Japanese traditional food eaten on New Year's eve and it's said that this custome was made in the middle of the Edo era.
It relates to the reason we eat it on new year's eve. Next I want to talk about the reason we eat the year-crossing buwheat noodle.
The second is the wish to cut off your troublesomes, and not carry them over to the new year.
According to a website, which conducted an internet survey to 1000 people, about 80 percent of people (in Japan?) eat the year-crodding buckwheat noodle.

What is Chrismas?
I don't like Chrismas, and most Japanese are not Christian.
Why do they celebrate Chrismas Day?
I think most Japanese young people are celebrating Chrismas in order to have sex with their partners.
They should re-name Chrismas day, ``Japanese sex day.``
Everybody in the world already knows that all Japanese people are peverted, they will not be surprised at all.
Stupid Japanese singers release Chrismas songs in winter lol.
What do foreingers in Japan think about this stupid habit?
Japan is just a follower and dog of wenstern countires, we don't celebrate Chinese New Year at all.
Japanese should stop this repulsive event unless they properly understand the meaning of Chrismas.

If we consider the eco-friendly options, we should check the date on the pakage and choose the older stuff.
Bcause the older ones keep aging until they are abondaned if people choose only fresh ones.

They don't need it, but elderly peaples want to sit there!

During the holidays, I have to finish my school work, essay and other impotant tasks which still aren't done.
I've gotta tell you somthing that's been on my mind.
We were instintly attracted to each other.
Why do we make beautiful plans for the future when we are accupied and do not carry them out when we are free?

He had nothing to grab onto and could hardly stand, but the midle-aged man on the priotity seat just kept sitting.
That milde-aged man looked at the old man and looked at me again. I thought his conscience was starting to bother him.
I must work and perfome my experiment tomorrow morning.
However, I could not agree less. Based on the view that other training institutions (such as vocational colleges) are better suited to teach practical tachniques, forcing universities to teach educaiton courses would violate our freedom to choose our career path.
Because universities are not the only places that can provide employment preparation courses, but are the only places providing acedemic educaion.
Apparently, no other institution can replace universities 'ability to cultivate people in a particular acedemic field, and that is the main reason why people pay theie tuition fees.
Moreover, universities are not the best place for practical skilld trainings. There are thousands of insititutions and employers who can provide the more up-to-date training that the workforce needs to perform their jobs.
In sum, in comparison with universities, employers and other institutions are better-equipted and better-quanlified to prepare people for the employment market.
The graphic of that was drawn by the famous Japanese desighner who did the animation for ``Evangelion``.
It's Blues, which Clapton is always in, meets hip-hop rythem style which is really comfortable enough for me to listen to it for about 10 years.

Recently, we have been runnning up a big medical bill in Japan,

This counceling is not compulsory.
In China students learn English from middle school to college, but, there are not many students who can learn English well. First our mindset is wrong. Some of them think that learnning English is a burden. To pass the exam is their only purpous.
Second, the big circumstance is so bad. It is very difficult for you to find people to communicate with you in English. Someone may think if one person got a high mark, his or herEnglish is very good. I do not think so. We all konw that language is a tool that we can use to communicate with others.

The night safari and taxy companies are friends or couples.
I am a brave man, but when we tookt a tram there, I sat beside a fat American couple because they possibly cannot run faster than me.

I prefer living in a domitory rather than living off campus.
Living in a domitory gives us many oppotunity to make a lot of friends.
Secondly, living in a domitory is much more convenient than living off campus.
Most domitories are located very close to classrooms.
Finarry, I will spend less money if I lived on campus.
As a domitory resident, I will not have to pay for gas, electorocity, or water, like an apartment resident does.
In addition, I will not have to pay for funiture such as desks or beds.
I will not need a car either, so I will not be concerned about insurance, gas or parking. Consequently, the dorm is the more economical choise for me and my parents who are paying for my education.

In the film, President Mubarak doesnn't know anything about the conditions of the people.
This film seems to say that the president is a victim of his ministers and government that tell him that the country is doing well and everything is ok.
It wants us to believe that the president doesnn't know about the problems and obstacles that Egyptians encounter.
This cook blews the whistle on the corruption in Egypt and tell the president exactly what happens in the country.
It is hard to beleive that a president could be so naive.

When you look up a word in this dictionary, it always gives you a clear definision of the word in a user-friendly layout.
I used to use a Japanese-English one (and addmittedly still use it from time to time), but now I usually use the English-English one.
This is because I find that it is a more efficient and interesting way of learning a language to read the definision of each word in its original language.
Beaside this, the more harder part in the English language is the pronuntation (talk), the combinations of characters do not have the same sound that I can find in my native language and the same combination have a different pronunciation in others words, this is a nightmare for me.

What do you think about the difference between spending about a hunred thousand vnd travelling by bike and paying only 50000 vnd for a commuter ticket.
Futhermore, if you travel by bus, you don't have to wait in line to buy a parking ticket, or pay a fine because you went through a red light or were riding without a safety helmet.
I used to see some terrible bike accidents so maybe travellling by bus is safer.
Besides, when the weather is bad-too hot or too cold-choosing the bus for travelling is resonable.

When a woman resists a man's solutions he feels his competence is being qustioned.

Each of these statements eitheer invalidates or attempts to explain upset feelings or offers a solution designed suddenly to change her negative feelings to positive feelings.

Farst diary
To change the subject, earthquakes& tunami are terrible.
The cerebral wave activity is clasified into groups, each one named with a Greek letter: Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Theta.
So, Alpha waves have a frecuency of 0. 5 and 0. 4 cycles per second, and they are often found in a state of deep sleep.
Theta waves have a frecuency of 5 and 7 cycles per second, and they are found in the state between wakefulness and dreaming.
Alpha waves have a frecuency between 8 and 14 cycles per second, and they are found in states of peace and a relaxed alert.
Beta waves have a frecuency of 15 and 22 cycles per second, and they are found in a state of crisis, anxiety and agressiveness.
The massive production of Alpha waves in children makes them have a great learning capacity that can even allow them to attain/ achieve super-learning or acelerated learning when there is a state of peace.
On the other hand, if there is a state of agressiveness or stress, learning cannot be achieved.

The English poet Wordsworth said that ``The child is father of the man when he raises the son up innocently`` 1900 has lived on the sea since he was born, cut off from the outside world which is full of lies. He was innocent forever and had no flae until the moment of his death.
When the grown-up 1900 sat in front of the piano, using his slender hands; which are smooth like the keys, the ship bouncing on the sea waves, the piano's pulling and melodious tones, entranced by the music that he played for the poor people, my heart followed the tones up and down and the happiness on eeveryone's face.
Someone said that 1900 is happiness. He lives with his favourite music, people surrounding him are all friendly and kind, he needn't care zbout numerous complicated things and disturbances. Is this true? Everytime the boat draws into the shore, he looks at the island in a lonely way. He called strangers secretly with a nervous and expectant voice, ``hello, you don't know me, but, can we have a chat?``. Especially when that tramp told 1900 his experience. He wanted to experience standing on the island and listen to the sea. What would that be like? I'm not 1900, but I can definitely identify with his loneliness and longing-he was very keen to be on the island that he had never experienced.

It is said that in the 19 centry in american, Las Vegas had already become a fairly famous place where rich and wealthy people spend their money.
At that time, there were few casinos there but each of them provided good service for custorms to enjoy ther time there.
At firt the custormers mostly consist of the rich and famous people, but as time goes by, the economy got better, so it brought more typical people without fame or a high place in society to Vegas to try their luky.
At that time, almost every casino brought out a new service in which the custorms were able to buy a kind of dinner with chicken and some meat in it.
That was such a cheap choice for most players, so it gruadtully become an American motto: Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!

How do mivies or TV affect people? No. 4
Heroes and heroines achieve great sucess of their business, attain sweet love of their life, and gain high respect of their fame so easily within a two-hour long movie.
When watching it, audiences can experience the same events and share the same feelings. As a result, this whole process would fulfll their fantasies and cause them to find balance in their lives, or to some degree, lose the balance in their lives. This all depends not only on the movies but also the audiences themselves.
To put it differently, takss are arduous for mass media to bring people laughter, joy and relaxation, and at the same time some pedagogic meanings.

Hello, my friends. First of all, I want to apologize to all my friens at lang-8 for being absent for this long period due to the requirements in my last year of college. No doubt that I miss you all. I pick up this topic because everybody here is talking about the referendum in sudan these days. To the people who don't know much about Sudan, it is the biggest country in Africa and located on east side of Africa; south of Egypt. My country has struggled with political instability and prolonged wars since being liberated from the Britich 50 years ago. Unfortunately Sudan was born with wars and the most harmful one was in South Sudan. That war is considered the longest war in the history of Africa or modern history. The war continued 50 years after liberation, killed two million Sudanese citizens, and caused four million Sudanese citizens to emigrate due to the paralyzed economy we had during this ugly war.
Sudan is a country of diffrente races, languages, and religions, but specific parts in the north are more educated than other parts of Sudan. This is because during britich rule the south and west of Sudan were closed areas and the government didn't allow any cultural developmental. So, soon after liberation the Sudanese found themslef with big challenge of how to rule this wide country where the north Sudanese were more educated. The government was ruled by them and other citizens felt like this government doesn't represent them. The biggest historical mistake is that this government did not change britch policy of closed lands. As result of this huge mistake, the racism grew between Sudanese populations and rapidly the southern Sudanese took up arms to get their rights in Sudan. At that point, no Sudanese, including southern Sudanese, had the idea for a separation. They just wanted their rights in their country as whole Sudan. And, as days go by, and wars burned houses and killed children and women, the idea of separation from Sudan arose. In 2005, the happiest year of sudan history, the government and (splm) stopped the war in South Sudan the Nifasha Peace Agreement has born. The goverment promised a lot political changes: the system became democratic and a successful election also occurred. sothren sudanes can rule their own lands by the new fedral system. In the Nifasha Peace Agreement, the goverment sponsored the referendum right after six years of the treaty. This period was supposed to be the rehabilitation period of the wars affect on the south. The south took more than 50 persent of the oil to rehabilitate southren Sudan by SPLA. Due to the bad situation in the south and huge corruption, not many changes took place in health and education and most of the money was spent on southren sudanes army. Due to the environment wich lacks any trust, now the 6 years is running out fast and the Sudanese face a referendum one month from now. The news is not good about the south, because a lot of politicians see the sapration as the start of a new phase of war in Sudan because most of the oil in Sudan lies in the boundaries between south and north. And these boundaries have not been defined yet, so the Sudanese are worried about witnessing another endless war. The situation is very tense and everybody is expecting the worst, but there is hope that the referendum will lead to unity. And if that occurs, it will be the true liberation of Sudan and a promising future. We pray for our children to be raised in a united Sudan without bloodshed.

I bought a fasion magazin recently, and I found a remarkable article.
People are always wonderring whether the country or the city is the ideal place to live.
The foremost reason for dwelling in the countryside is the soothing and confortable life provided by the pastoral view.
Those who have enjoyed the first cock crow in the morning, the twettering of birds in the trees and the breathtaking sight of the rising sun would go into rapture at only the mere mention of the idyllic life.
Relaxed and suburban dwellwers are able to hold a more positive attitude for life and achieve more accomplishments.
Another subtle explanation rests on the fact that country habitants are fortunate enough to enjoy the cozy and pleasant amience of the family without exhausting their social life.
On the contrary, it would be far more difficutlt to acquire such pleasure for those urbanites.
Naturally, it is possibly too reckless to assert that nothing beneficial comes from city life since several accompanying merits aslo come along with it.

I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the certer of the city which is surrounded by a park.
There is a comercial zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kinds of businesses: banks, bars, chemists, cinemas, pet shops, restaurants, fast food restaurants, grocers, travel agencies, supermarkets and others.
Consequently, I realized that although ciclyng outside helped me to improve my fitness, really I enjoyed most breathing fresh air and taking pleasure in the countryside.

Using public transport can be difficult, because we have a strict time and, normally, we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely desconfortable.
One argument for not using the car is that petrol is very expensive, but public transport tickets are also increasing, so that advantange is not so good, actually.
The story took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by doctors and cientifics.
But we shouldn't forget the pollution cause by cars. We should use a bicycle or public transportetion more.
If we are working with sameone in the same job who lives near us or is our neighbour, we can go to work in the same car. This way we use less petrol.
The governents are also important for taking care of the environment.
In total, there were 32 pelople, a white kittie and a dog.
That night, the dog, the kittie, Tom and Michel slept in the same room, and that wasn't too bad.
When Michael got up in the morning, he realized that his kittie had disapeared, and he found Tom's dog with some white hair in his mouth.
He thought that the dog had eaten the kittie during the night, so he shouted at Tom, opened the door and went away.

The environment is our surroundings. There is no aleartness in our locality. They are busy with their own work. No one focuses on or sees what is hapening in our town. They usually speak about how hot it is today, but they don't know what makes it this hot. I am interested in planting trees and making our sorrounding clean. Some people used to burn the forest as if the forest is useless. Man is greedy because all the things we get from the forests are free.
Managemant acountant practice is very important for an organization for making decisions about human resources, sales, marketing and potential customers.
To take care of the environment, each of us has to do something such as propaganda to the people in the country. About my village, we use banana leaves instead of nilon, dispose of garbage sensibly... and so on.

I have neded to use English a lot of times during my professional activities. For that reason I took some English lessons many years ago.
I can tell you that I feel I can understand over 90% when I'm listening and when I'm reading, but my main problem with English is, of course, when I have to speak. I fee terrible and without confidence. I think that I'm always thinking in Epanish and then doing the translation into English. Maybe at this moment, while I'm writing this composition, I'm making the same mistake. I know that learning English is a long process, but I must follow that process because I'd like to be an excellent bilingual person.
Currently, I'm working as a teacher at the university and teaching in English is my gol.
I also work as a freelance worker with the same subjects because it is necessary to increase my incons.

Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions. This mostly happens in high class famiies, as they foccus on achievements like power, political influence etc. On the other hand, for middle class families the old-fashioned values are still important as they are inherited from our ancestors in terms of values like honesty, kindness, loyalty, etc.

First of all, finishing high school is a rite of passage that indicates the begnin of a new chapter for students.
When you are travelling around the world by yourself, you gain a lot of knowledge, culture, discorves and, with all of this, you gain personal experencie.
The job provides, like the trip, responsibility and experencie.
The consequences aren't good as the reasons, for instance, they may have the career prejudicate, or they spend so many years travelling that they are too old to study at a uniersity.
Besides that, they have different points of view on many sublects, that is why they may not like the fun and the conversation in the social life with other students.
They cannot enjoy this chapter with oung and fresh thoughts.
It is a big dedcision, that brings great consequences and great experencies.
AAs an example, if a student needs to recuperate a subject or has to get a good mark, they can't go to do a sport because there is no time.
They would consider you as an indpendent person.
Accrodingly, you would take responsibitity for what you did.

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he had forgotten what he had to do. After thinking, he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her in his car as the doctor's clinic was far away from her house. Peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother's house in the next street. After he arrived, he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the street. He apologized to her and asked her to get into the car. "Never mind" she said and got in the car beside him.
However, travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine. Travelling by bus is not as convenient as getting in a car, but you can never know what might happen with your car, where it might get stuck in traffic or some other accedient might happen.

The reasons for stress are more diverse; perhaps because we have an exam period, family proplems or because we think in a negative way, or we have destroyed ourselves through long hours of working and canceld our needs for enough comfort, and lots of reasons to stress...
We must get rid of the stress quickly before we lose ourselves, because it's very harmful. For example, you can read a book, do sport, play music, eat delicious food, remmeber all the positive things that have happened to you, talk with someone who you trust, get rid of everything that makes you upset and makes your life tiring, go out and eat a meal with your best friends, and there are a lot of things you can do...
Remmeber that stress is not a lasting thing, and you can avoid it.
In other words, both bad sheets and the ones which are seperated badly need destroying in a safe way which can stop them from getting into the market.
Many people believe that nowdays there is no future for public transport, because travelling by car is so much more convenient, but others continue with the tought that they do help, for example, with travelling long distances.
The ticket doesn't cost too mutch and it is avaible for the majority of people, at least compared to buying a car.
Secondly, public transport is more eficent for travelling long distance than cars and people wouldn't have to purchase fuel.
When people need to tavel to other continents or far away, they may need a plane, wicth is a form of public transport, to complete the journey because they have to cross oceans and clomplicated distances that have different landforms.
However, a car is something which belongs to the person and he can do wathever he wants and find it in the same state he left it in, and sometimes public transport vehicles aren't left in the best way.

It depends on five main steps, which include desigh, preparation of metal plates, printing, inspection, packaging and destruction or disposal depending on whether the fourth step is good or bad.
Secondly, we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.
If it's good, they go to packing and distribution, whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well.

The Brazil and Nederlands games were a real test of our health.
And I think that it's not technology that will change, but the people and their caracteres.
Unfortunaly, for this generation, there won't be real relationships, all relationships will become virtual relationships.
According to my experience, if we don't exagerate the way we use technologie like the internet, phone, satellite.
For example, now high-heeld shoes are very trendy but they cost a lot and most women don't look good in them.
Transportation is one of the most essential parts of our day to day life; whether it is puplic or private, transport takes the same priority in each person's life from the very early days.
In the age before industrialisation came into exsitance, people also used various alternatives to travel from one place to another.
Then the technology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to make the transport more convinient.

Additionally, because public transport is expensive and does not have a comprehensive coverage of most cities, private cars are more attractive for most poeple.
Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient than by public transport, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.
But public transport has a future for a lot of reassons. First, time. If the place you want to reach is really far, the different types of vehicles of public transport will get you there faster than your car. Also, the complications about the field, like if you want to go from America to Europe, there is no highway that crosses the ocean. You need an airplane and, unless you have one, you will not be able to achieve travel between continents with your car. A different reasson is politics, because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska, you will not need to pass through Canada. Comfort is a really important reasson, because driving for 8 hours is exhausting and it will also be unsafe. Economics is a factor too, because the wear and tear on your car will be more than in normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do. It will be more expensive than on public transport.
In conclusion, for me, it is a lie that public transport has no future. However, they have to make improvements to this, like the use of better types of fuel or energy. One way is using renovable sources of energy, such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hydraulic(water),Also, there are biodisel and gasoline extracted from seaweed.
Dear Anne, Thank for your letter asking about my fmily and my friends.
When somedoby gets home, he wants only to relax in front of the television.
Besides this, TV companies have understood sports provide this relaxess moment, mainly for men.
In this view, I think that though there are lots of sports on Televison, there are not too many, because people have looke for it.
When the day came, we performed an amazing coreography and we went back home with 3 gold medals.
This American band is known for their lyrics that something different from other bands, something close to an emocional statement.
My techer said that public transport has no future in our society, because travelling by car is so much more convenient. Nevertheless, I disagree with her opinion because if we use public tranposrt we will pollute less.
Without travelling, people would be very bored, life would be very monotunes.
Nowdays people use cars a lot.
In the past, it wasn't like that. People did not have cars. They just relied on puplic transport.
There are a few people who use puplic transport, like students and people who have a low income. In my veiw, I can say the public transport might be going to e close because nobody is going to beclose

I have been playing this sport since twelve years ago. This sport has taught me to respect others and not to assault them.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is that I don't want to be weak. I wouldn't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule: the strong dominate the weak. When I step foot in the gym, I forget everything: shcool, home.... Therefore, I enjoy it.

There are advantages and disadvantages; television can also cause a dipendence, cartoons and "stupid" programs can harm young people most.
Today, there are many children that have a dipendence on television, they prefer to stay at home to watch the various children's TV programs, while once our parents preferred hanging out with their friends.
Television can be a useful strument if it is used with caution. Therefore, I recommend using it less to prevent damage to the mind.
In order to help reduce pollution, I take acction using the three "Rs": reduce, reuse and recycle, so I am more and more eco-friendly.
I reduce the use of innecesary power at home. In other words, I turn on a light that I need while I use it; I take cooler showers; I heat only the neccesary rooms.
In order to reuse, I convert all things reusable, for example, a plastic bottle as a plant pot; a glass bottle as a food container. I take my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a plastic shopping bag if a salemen offers me one.
A car is less expensive, more confortable, faster and safer.
For example, travelling by train is cheaper and travelling by plane is faser.
On the other hand, it helps to reduce the polution made by cars,..
The picture illustrate the progrocess of making notes.
Then, preparation of the metal plates and skilled machinists are needments.

Now, to answer your question, I have many favourite places near my town because I live in a lovely little town, but there is one place taht is special to me: 'A Fervenza do Pedregal'. '
It is a veri quiet place. Because of its location, in the middle of the forest, only a few people know how to get there.
It is an invledible forest, the ground is covered in low grass and there is a little river where you can swim. It is the perfect place to have a quiet day.
That is all I can tell you about this place. I hope tath my answer will help you with your project.
What is your last neame?

If you try this sport in the wrong way you could have health problems. For example, you could have problems with your hands, in your neek and in your legs.
Emily knew she would have to come to a decisión soon.
The problema for Emily was that her boyfriend was as cold as the weather.
She thought he was so boring, but she didn't want to be alone. she didn't know how to live on ther own and Emily was utterly terrified of being alone.
The purpose of this report is to make people more aware of the importance of taking care of the environment in order to erradicate this problem which has serious consequences nowadays.
The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate rubbish from my town.
Combating the distriction of the enviornment, this is a serious problem throughout the world.
Nowadays, many trees and grassland areas are damaged in many countries, lots of building are constricated.
And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it.
For instance, people need too many places to build the modern society, so they cut down lots of trees, burnning many grassland areas.
Another factor is that the animals do not control themmselves and eat the plants leading to the distriction of the ecosystem.
Althought this change makes the life of people efficient, the problem should not be ignored.
It would really be helpful if the government made tighter restrictions. In today's world, there are lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroying the forest, farmland and wetland, discharging waste water and emitting greenhouse gas. It leads to a serious enviorment problem.
Taking the train is more cost effective than taking a car to work, as petrol is costly and the new transportation office has reduced the cost of tickets to assist with the daily living expesnes we encounter.
The other benefit of taking public transport is fewer people are taking cars, reducing the amount of toxic gases released into the environemnt.
Karate is one of the best sports I have ever enjoyed in my life. One of the reasons behind my passion for karate is that it's a means of tamming the mind and the body.
I have learned to get control of myself when someone teaes me, and to be alert as well. Also, it helps me to always look slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well. People who want to start doing karate have to be patient.
They should emerse themselves in daily exercise as well as eat healthy meals to keep them active. for instance, it's adviced to eat large amounts of fruits and fresh vegetables because they contain a lot of vitamins that the body needs to work properly.
My favorite sports are football, baskeball, Formula One and Tennis.
For example, in our country, "Shinkansen" which measns burrett train, is famous and very fast.
"Blue train", which has many beds on the train and we can sleep comfortabully on the train.
Second, travelling by train is safe and reasonable conpared to planes.
TTravelling by train is cheep and getting a chicket is easy for us in our country.
And terolism is scarce also.
A plane which was travelling from Egypt to Russia was explosed by terolist last month.
What did you do yestreday?
I'm nineteen years old and from this city but living in a domitory at Ton Duc Thang university.
When I am running, all the preesure I felt is gone.
We have Eather first, then people, than our house.
Eather is our home, we all have to protect it.
But now people are distroy it.
Just for mony for more houses, but if we destroy it, we will all die. Our money will be gone, our house will be gone, we will have nothing.
Besides, some people destroy farland to build houses, but if one day there is no farmland, then what should we eat? Nothing at that time. We couldn't eat anything!So what should we do?
So my idea is that all the countries and all the people stop using farmland, forests and wetland to build houses, grow more trees, portect our world, our home star!
The lecturer desagree with the paragraph suggesting that the mentioned test developed by Alan Turing does not answer the main question: Can a computer think?
First, the lecturer talks about "Saran", who proposed a challange to prove that Turing's test was not conclusive, and that he created a paradox.
He selected people to go into a Chinese room. There was a computer in the Chinese language with diferente symbols. The Americans showed diferente behavior. They did not understand what was on the computer screen.
Science, I just remember I have always liked motor racing, but one of my frevourite is Formula 1.
The Formula 1 seson starts in erly spring and ends in late autumn.
I try to watch every race every fournight and the training the day before the race.
Ferrari make one of the fastest cars in the world, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac as they were in the past.
If sameone likes cars, then they should go to Formula 1 races to hear the bolid engine sound. I think that is the best sound I have ever heard in my life.
One day, the son of Lucy and her husband went to carve holes in the dirt to make a game, he made five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewelry that had belonged to generations of gods. So he started throwing that for fun. One time that he took the jewelry, it consumed the mind of the little guy and that made the jewelry emit some sounds that only giants could hear, so a mountain stood up that was the face of a giant and he perceived negative vibes, so he killed the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods.

I started this sport when I was 10 years old. where My father was also playing this sport, but he started it when he was older than me. He was about 30 years old. where Squash is one of those games that can be played at any age. I love this game because I find it exercises the whole body at the same time. We run in a small space, moving our hands in stretched and different ways, and at the same time we work our minds, so it needs care and quik thinkink, as much any as exercise you will find down the road.
I think that anyone who wants to start a doing sport should play squach, which gives a you flexible and healthy body. At the same time, this sport can be played for a long period of time without caring about age.
I have praticed swimming for 3 years. I am a good swimmer and I have competed in different swimming tournaments.

Althouth public transport is cheap and more environmentally friendly, it is not as flexble or comfortable as the car.
Exept for in the big cities, public transport is not an easy way to get around the city. That means that in the future even more people will stop using it.

In today's class, we were discussing wheather or not we agree with the often enourmous salaries of fooball players.
For me, as a passionated soccer player, it is a good point to consider.
I recommand to the clubs, be warned.
By this aciton a Ronaldo or Messie can be paid and it is possible to buy the best team for the league, like Bayern Munich is doing at the moment.
This makes football or soccer ever more equisite to a certain group of fans-hooligans.
But if the prices are too high, no onw will visit the games anymore.
First, I think that this job is perfect for me because I have travelled around the world and I know a lot of different kinds of food. In fact, on my last trip to Japan I learned to cook shushi.

So, in conclusion, I think that if you contract me, you will get an axcellent person and an excellent worker.
In my opinion, public trasnport is more expensive and it is less comfortable than a car, because a car is faster than public transport.
Online Lerning
Positiv things about online lernign are that you are more mobile with your smartphone and you don't have to carry so much paper with you. Also, you're on your own and at your own lerning speed, which makes it more spesific to the user themself. Maybe you're more confortable on your Smartphone than with paper.
Negaticvs about online lerning are that you're not listening to much from a real person and more from a Computer. If pyou don't have any listening things in the app you don't lern how to pronounce the words. In my personal opinion, its better to lern from a teacher not only because you lern to pronounce the words correctly, but you also lern from a person, which is, in my opinion, way better. I think we spend enougth time on smartphones, so I don't think it's the best if we use them to lern as well.
For words, I think it's perfect, but all the grammer and talking, I think you need a teacher.
The advertisements are a bit tricky because they know exactly when children watch, for example, sfter school.
Recently, there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building houses, which accour for some debation.
Apparently, it is a good thing, because it is a significient symbol of the development of a country; however, on the other hand, doing large-scale building projects may bring a galaxy of probems.

Nowadays, I usually go back to the swimming pool at the weekens.
"So many friends learend to swim.
Then, the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.
The next is called partially damaged shees, and bank notes are separaed into good and bad. Good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed; the bad ones will be destroyed by fire.
This is the method of making bank notes, and the operater should pay attention to the printed sheets and how to inspect them.
The most important step is the inspectation by hand. That is to say, they should be separated into good ones, which are to be cut into bank notes and delivered to the banks, and the bad ones, which can't be utilised and are burnt securely in the last stage.

Tennis. Tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play, but it's a professional sport and it needs more hard training and more time to be perfect at it. First, why did I choose tennis? Seriously, in 2003 it was my first time watching the game on TV when I saw Roger Federer play. I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to his professional movement when playing the ball. From that time, I was interested in this game and watching all the championships, so more time, time and time it is my favoirite sport.
Aisha is in her therties.

The company responsible for rubbish collection collects the garbage, already separated by the families, and afterwards does the recicling.
As well as the informative sessions about the enviorenment organized by the Mayor for all of the residents, it also has lots of staff that clean the streets, take care of the city gardens and collect the garbage.
My favourit sport is football. I love it so much. When I was young, I used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona. I used to play with my friends in the street and we were so happy doing that, and after that, we played on a football pitch like in real football. I love Cristiano Ronaldo so much. He is the best player in the world. A few people have told me that Messi is the best player, but I feel angry when I hear that, because that is not true. So I am looking forward to meeting my favourite player one day. It's like a dream for me.

Indeed, all the indicators show that humain behavior will not change, at least in the coming decades.
The way of livng changes every day: if we think about our grandparents ', but also about our parents' lives, we notice many differences.
Above all, they talked more. We live in the era of telecomunication and no one could live without their mobile phone or their computer.
Moreover, also, simple things have changed. For example, the food we eat. Some time ago, everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone always eats "junk food" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy!
About food, I imagine a future society in which restaurants won't exist. People will eat only junk food and food which has been prepared before, food in tins... so all unhealthy thinghs, which will cause many problems.
But phobias are fears which we experience that are life-threatening and they can distrupt everyday life, but people can get over them with the right sort of therapy.
So if we want to live a life which isn't controlled by our fears, we must try to be more objective and pay mre attention to real dangers.

tube and train, but is there a future for them or not? I am going to answer this question by discussing disadvantanges and advantages and, finally, I will give my personal opinion.
Secondly, public transport is more ecological and less polluting for the enviromment, because it produces less polluting emissions, and many public vehicles use green energy, such as electricity or gas.
In conclusion, from my point of view, public transport is more necessary now than ever before. Cities contain more automoviles and the pollution is worse .We need to change our way of thinking, and try to use public transport as an alternative to improve the enviromment of our cities.
Some buses have special and preferencial seats for old people.
Many cars poluent the planet and people are allergic to the pollution.
The train doesn't cause poluition.

I suppose their lifstile is intolerable, resteless and I really sympothise with them. The majority of outstanding and appreciated people are frustrated.
They turn into arrogant and furious idols because of a lack of ptivate life and perpetual attention.
That is a pitiless trial for celebrities but, through thick and thin, they go on .They archieve the goals made exceptionally for the sake of money and vanity.
In itself, the film didn't have an special topic, but I can describe it as a friends film, as there is a lot of laughts, jokes, and it shows that friendship is the greatest thing that exists.
The public transport most used in Toluca is the bus because it is the cheapest, but it is very bad and unsafe. The qualiti of it is very bad; the buses are old and obsolete, they have broken windows and old broken seats.
The service is very bad. The drivers are very angry and stressed out so they do not drive with cauition. In Toluca there are reports of high numbers of accidents involving buses.
I think if the goverment do the best work about the transport, they can save it.
It is true a car is more confortable, but it uses a lot of mineral recurses like petrol wich can pollute the atmosphere.
I don't think public transport does not have a future. There are a lot of people who cannot buy a car and they have to use communite transport.
The Internet is a useful tool for everyone, so we are communicating with distant friends, and we look for important information when we are studying or entretainament ourselves.
First of all, I am going to talk about the adavantages and disadvantages of this topic.
The first adavantage is that the Internet is very fast. For example, when you want information about something.
The second advantage is that the Internet by websites, such as twiter, Facebook... You can speak with your quick friend, or you can meet ith them on the website. Therefore, you do not call them on the telephone, because the internet is very cheap.
As for disadvantanges, at present, children are aways playing with their computer games and mobile phones.
To sum up, the Internet is the most important advance in the world, but there are a lot disadavantages and advantages.
From my point of view, the Internet is useful for everyone, but we should not abuse it, and should carring out other activities.
Recently I have had a job offer from a company located in London and it requires me to have an ILETs score of 6.5 for the visa.
In particular, some people don't have a car and some elderly people find it difficult to drive a car by themselves, so public transport helpeing them a lot.
That is why I think public transport is really important for the public and there are a lot of important things that will be possble in the future.
And maybe you will become a famous player or an ordinary player, but you will feel like a famuos one.
I think the sheep should be transferred to a place where there is specialty in animals with the same condition.
We bocome not only older, but also wiser. We learn, but the most useful thing to learn is to get a lot of experiences and, for sure, to make mistakes. But we have to be honest with ourselves and admit our mistakes to avoid them in the future.

Nowadays, technolgy is more modern than in the past and people are always developing their inventions to make them more useful.
We as humans living in these days, rely on technolgy. Every aspect of our lives is supported by technolgy.
One example is television. In the past, we used it only for watching the news and movies, but as time goes by and the technolgy develops, now television has other functions.
Second, tthese days, television has become modern and that means television can be connected with the internet.
In conclusion, televeision can entertain and also educate, because television programs do it in an interesting way.

Firstly, they design the bank notes 'backgroud colour, its artwork and security issues.
Then the sheets of bank notes are printd. Printing colour on both sides and use sprcial ink and the images are slightly raised.
Finally, they find good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets.
At the same time, bad sheets and bank notes are securely destoryed.
The other reason for my opinión is that almost all people preffer using the eyes and ears to other people, rather than write and listen to understand new things.
That's why I think that it's a good momento to see things in a new way and that can be a very good opportunity.
Deffinitly, it does not always depend on the kind of programme, but I think that nowadays, a lot of televisión ofert help for people to develop more effectively.
I am communicating with you with the purpose of letting you know that we are going to set up a meeting at my office with the purpose of discussing how we could use social media to improve the communication with our suplliers. I think a great time for the meeting would be next Monday at 4:00 p.m

First of all, we should think of a design and dicide the background colour and artwork, or even security issues.
The people recycle the rubbish and they throw away the rubbish in diferents containers.
While I strugged to walk.
Finally, I saw a light appeare and I woke up.
We will have people that use the television as fun, most of the time; but we also have other people that use television for searchs.
For example, the chanel ''Animal Planet'' has a lot of information about animals and how they live.
Nowadays, everybody has the ability to buy a television, so the numbers of TV viwers is going up; even if you are poor or rich; most can watch a movie, or a documentary.
Also, I think swimming can keep your body fit and it can make the swimmer cool down when it is a summy day.
I can't pronunciate well.
The home was on the shore. There was a tunnel and it's hole was in the deep. At first he used to be polite and obay the other orders.
Once a day, he met a girl called Sarah. She was 9 years old. Although Michael was bigger, Sarah could control him. Every day they went to the sea to play and swim until the sun set. Once a day Sarah made a challange to Michael about who could enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out of the other hole on the shore, but Michael was afraid. He was asking himself which animals could be there or if there was air there, but he had no choice, so he accepted the challange. Sarah told him she would go first. She took a breath... a deep one, and started to dive.
Our city is quite clean and livable; people are more careful than before.
Generally, we use a criket ground which has an oval shape.
I tend to ride my bicycle from home to work, I haven't used my car or buses for a long time, because it is not healhty and costs a lot.

I switch on the home hiting for a temporary period. When I am working from home, I use more energy to warmht my home.
We learn to really segreation waste and, in the future, how we could, for example, use the same glass a second time.
Anyway, a lot of people will need some transport in some cases, not privat, but public, and we can't say that this kind of transport willl not be useful.
As we are fully dependant on indivitual generators, these are causing multiple problems with the weather due to their smoke, oil and gas left behind, in addition to noise, of course, because they are the main source of the 18 countinous hours of noise.
People, espicially grnerator owners, have started using Canaopies, using very long pipes to get rid of as much as they can of the polution.
Other resedential areas, using their potential to maintain the environment by planting trees, roses, have nemourse green spaces.
Also, recycling the trushes is a very inteligent way to keep the town clean and get multiple uses out of the products in industry lines.
on the other hand, the eldest people in our city have many socity responsiblties and are encourging the youngest people to participate in the annual gardening festival for the indoor and outdoor gardens.
I like the Indian resturants in the city. In addition, the infrastructure and roads are well orgnaise.
In the village where I live, there is a lot of vegetation. For that reason, we try to protect the environment. One of the things we do is to do mantainance every week to the vagetation zone, checking if there is any garbage. To avoid this, we teach the younger generation enviromentalist actions so they don't throw cans, paper, or candies on the floor. They can also help the older people. There are cases where a person throws garbage on the street or on the vegetation. To avoid that happening again, we have a punishment that is to pay some money. If they don't, they won't be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again, unless they are visitors. In that case, we tell him or her the way we live in the village and, we give him or her advice to keep a beautiful place without garbage.
Another environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of them. For that we have a care centre and, other additional institutions. We also make environmental protection centers where people can visit and learn about this. To sum up, our village is very focussed on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us.
If you want to have fun, you can go to Parque de la Costa. There are many interesting rolercoasters.
Nowdays, in school, we learn a lot of subjects which we use more or less in our lives. Some of them are really important, but some of them are just a waste of time.

In conclusion, if you want to have a good time, you shoudl go to the cinema to see this film with your family, because it is an interesting and emotional film.
Transport polution is one of the most dangerous.
On the one hand, that quantuty of cars can't be forbidden, because it's a personal right to have one or not.
Also, another improving measure might be encreasing green areas in cities and towns.
Factories damage nearby areas and water extremaly badly.
In my opinion, firstly, new bilding on the banks must be forbidden at all.
But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way. Most people around the world can see any news live. Media is more helpful for people. Television is also used as a study resource, for example for smart classes,
saddenly, an old carrying a heavy load hit him and fell down.
I suggest everybody should have the same evening walk. You just need a pair of comfortable shoese!
Travelling privately makes one free of issues like harrasment.
I like a lot of activities, such as travelling, readillng, playing soccer and watching movies.
Besides, public transport will reduce traffice jams.
Finally, the kind of life that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help people to have a more comfortable, easier and faster way of life, but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more. Also, things will be faster of waste to make people change their possessions more often and stimulate consumerism.
Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon of armland, forest and wetland disappearing because of some long-term human activities, for instance housing and transport networks are built, destroying the balance of the environment.
Firstly, it is clear that more houses and transport networks are convenient for our people. What is known to us is that the population growth is a big problem which creates a need for more palce for living in.
And builing more transport networks is also a benifit for us, for example, the high-speed rail can shorten the time spent on traveling, while the animals may not welcome it.

Nowadays, there is very little public transpotr. The general public prefer much faster and more convenient ways of traveling around. Though pulic transport is used in mager cities to avoied traffic conjustion, it is wlidly reconizge that public transport is eco-friendly.
Many people say that public transport is not confortable. That's true. From my point of view, a bus is not so unconfortable.

The number of vehicles on the roads keeps increasing and causes congestion and pollution, which are far more severe than the inconvenience caused by public transportation.
Thus, I think the future of public transportation will be more proferous.

Taking into consideration our interest in the field of thrillers, under no cicumstances should we miss it!

Parkour is a discipline in which the main proporse is to train your body and mind to be able to pass through a point A to point B, in any kind of environment, the safest and fastest way, without causing any harm to your body.
Parkour was developed in Lisses, Frace, around the 1980's.
One of the faundations used to develop Parkour was the Natural Method, created by Georges Hébert.
Basicaly, the method is based on developing the main foundations of moviment of the human body. These are: swim, run, walk, jump, quadruped moviment, climb, lift things, balance and defend yourself.
Raimond Belle was a former Vietnam souldier and worked as a fireman in the French army.
The roots of Parkour were developed by him and he taught some Parkour thechniques to the firemen who he used to work with.
His son, David Belle, was taught some of the faundations of Parkour too.
Some people say that David criated Parkour but, in fact, his father developed all the ideas of the discipline.
Parkour isn't just a physical discipline, there is also the philosofical part. Altruism, "be strong to be useful" (it is actually a frase from the Natural Method), develop your body and mind so that, in a dangerous situation, you will be able to save yourself and other people, and so on.
Therefore, it is due to its philosofy and the joy that I feel before, during and after a training session, that Parkour is my favorite sport.

I agree with the statement, that fmous people deserve to have a private life without jouralists following them all the time.
Sometimes it happens that journalists write some silly gosspis about famous people which is not true.
Altought it doesn't mean that the press should write about your private life.
And, as a draback of being a celebrity, they are followed by papparazzi almost everywhere.
Besides, being foollowed by unknown people must be quite a scary experience.

When we were schoolgerls, we used to spend all our free time together.
To find out about other cultures and get new knowledge completly different from school.
On the other hand, maybe if we have a break before university, the routine of working and studing every day could break.

To sum up, as thought cars are too covenient to some extent, but the cost will reduce the benefits.

Therefore, most of these famous people complain about this, but it is logical that all the media, television, radio and journalists are constanlty devoting every minute of the day to them, because people are interested in them, in knowing what they are doing every second, in knowing who they are with, in knowing what they like or don't like, their hobbies, in short, in knowing everything about them.

Nowadays, people's lives are undergoing an unexpected change all because of globalitation.
Globalitation started in the 20's, so a huge proportion of the population has experienced this change. In my opinion, it is kind of good.
Personal contact shows a decrease in this time, because people don't want to face their real problems. Instead, they can see all the poblems happening in the world on their smartphones.
In the future, people will comunute via their computers, cellphones, and tablets, and this kind of technology will lead us to a lonely life.
Of course, there will be some more electronical things like some new mobile phones with functions we could not expect right now, and there will be some other gadgets.
To put it in a nutshell, we could say that our global world will be more electronical, and there will be more gadgets, but that won't change our lives dramatically.
However, others companies will dominte half of the projected market share in jeans next year.

My name is Pawarit Chonlahat and I have lived in Bangkaen district since 2010.I found that this area has changed so rapidly, such as, now it has a lot of condomedium a long the main road and nowadays this area has a big shopping mall and a modern hospital and a large police station. That makes my life so convenient and safe because I can walk from my house to go to the shopping mall in about 10 minutes and I can walk to the hospital in just about 5 minutes, so I didn't worry when I got sick and the large police station is located in front of the hospital. That can assure safety for everyone who lives in this area.
For this reason, this is the adventages of living in this area but because of many people in this area, traffic in rush hours especially in the morning is very heavy and it takes so long to drive a car to work .That is the disadvantage of living in this area. So, in my opinion, this area should have an improved transportation infrastructure like investment in Sky train system to cover this area.

The problem with this mansion is that it hides a lot of secrets and misteries which are going to be discovered by its temporary owners, who are a family whose husband went to war and died. So the real ocupants of the house are Nicholas, an easily scared boy, his sister Anne, who turns out to be one of the most important characters in the film, and their mother, who is called Grace and has a particulary obsession with catholisism.
The film descrives how the love that a mother can give to her children can easlily turn into an obsession. However, what makes this film so special is that it pretends to be a typical horror movie, but in its final scene, there is a sudden change wich makes it more interesting.
I would recomend this film to anyone, even those who are easily scared, because it is not like the resto of the horror movies. It is a film in which you are continuely discovering secrets as if you were another character.
So it is a cuestion that requires deeper reflexion from all of us.

Though the modern cities are emerging repaidly, the problems caused by excessively exploiting the enviorment are severly various.
Thered coral reef off the coast of Austrialia, for instance, serves as a shelter for algea and other tiny sea fishes and an index of enviroment fragility.
Due to the massive construction of five-star hotels on beaches, the biological chain there is cut off and enviromental variations are gone away.
On top of that, it is the regulation capacities of the enviorment for temperature, moisture and even sandstorms are eroding as less plants inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen into the whole system.

Although on some occasions some clothes styles are required, people should have the freedom to choose what clothesdo they want to wear, and it should not have consequences in our lives.

It is an amazing service, but not all the population have a car or the financial status to use an Uber, so people have to use public transportation, no matter if the bus or cab driver yells at them or drives badly. In Mexico, the public transportation, in particular the cabs, are not a very secure services, because some of the drivers steal and kindnap, in many situations they could kill you if you do not take precautions. But despite this, it is very sad that in that place people cannot do some things because they do not have the possibilities to pay for something more, so they have to take public transport.

I believe that there is no future for public transpot, using trains is mor convient and less expensive, so to decrease the carpon gases which are affecting the ozone layer, people should be aware of the effect of using public transpotation on the econmics and enviroment. goverements should encarge people to use other modes of transport. This subject should be issuesd in all media to teach and encrage people to use the wrigth mode of transpot.

With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of populations, a lot of agricultueal land, forest and ocesn has been used or destroyed to build more buildings and transport networks.
To start with, there are a wide range of problems it may leadding to.
Additionally, people now continue to destroy more agricultural land and forest in order to satisfy all their needs, which will distory the ecosystem, diversity and biodiversity, especially the endangered species.
In light of the problems mentioned above, there are various approaches that governments should adopt to deal with this problem. First of all, reducing building constructure from now on, and planting more trees instead.
Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human beings and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals.
To sum up, this unpleasant phenmenon and its problems should be worked on to resolve them before things get worse, ang the governments have to take the responsibility for that.
I took that decision because I was tired of trying to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted, so when I heard about that ooportunity, I said yes.
I want to say something about learning the English Languaje. It is hard for me for the following reasons:
First reason: the grammar that teachers or institutes teach is like the Spanish Languaje, my native Languaje.
I want to say that it is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verbs in Spanish, so just imagine the same but not in your native lenguaje.
Second reason: in English syntaxis, the rules for constructing paragraphs or sentences, the verb is written before the subject, but not always. What is the rule?

Whethere tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on our lives, it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorants.
Alongside its development, the ablity to travalling has become easier to such an extent that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.
The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism, as well as to the idea of globalisation, since a traveller is not just a citizen of his own country, but a global citizen.
There are countries, such as Greece or Bulgaria, in which the econmoy relies completely on tourism.
If tourism influences the econmy, it thereby influnces the environment, and if it influences the environment, it influences transport. How? people become more careful at their historcal sites, thereby preserving them. Transport is developed both on a small and a large scale.
On a small scale, in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.

Yes, I agree, if you planned the journey for a faraway distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it by car, because, firstly, you'll spend less time, your journey will be comfortable, you'll have the possibility to stop any where and for a long time, as you need to.
But if we are talking abot travelling across your city, would you prefer public transport or car?
I think that this is the guestion for everyone, and there can't be one answer for all, because one person can use public transport, and save in this way not only money, but the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t. because they spend more time travelling or they simply don't like to travell with other people.

I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant. It's name is "Lemon". I go there every week. It has different food to other restaurants. I like crispy chicken with garlic sauce. It's an excellent choice for me. And my favorite appitizer is susage and in order that dessert I like "Vadge" cake with chocolate sauce. I feel at ease when I go there.

I advise everyone to go there and enjoy their time there. Also, this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really. It's excellent. The striking thing for anyone, is that despite all of these advantages, the prices are not expensive.

Dear Sir or Madamme,
On the one hand, holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly about their experinces in life.

Regarding advertising, technology is having a huge and not always possitive impact on outdoor advertising.
It will suit me sometimes, and it will even be useful, but I'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggresive.
The way it feels aggresive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens, no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are.
But, technology is hre for better or worse, and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can.

The importance of working hard to achieve goalы and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen.
For instance, if my goal was to increase young people's awareness, some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblings.
The last step would be to recruit a staff of prfesional, experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide.
Undertaking a scholarship and admission to one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opprtunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school in a business setting, as well as develop the communication, organisation and numeracy skills I acquired at high school.

It is a ciclical process.
Rome had its hayday in the first century AD, but just three centuries later, it was only a shadow of its past.
One day in the future, another Franz Ferdinand could be killed, and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse for some country to declare war on another, but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have their roots in much older times.
As the causes of the Second World War had its roots in events that were the outcome of the First War, a Third, hypothetical war, could have its roots in a past conflict that may well have happenned already.
During the next centuries it was expanded, and in the 16th century, finally rebuilt in a Renaissance style, which has remained unchanged until today-the most representative remnant is probably the famous arcaded coutyard.

Everybody say it's the best period in our whole life; what they don't rembember is that it can also be the worst.
This could be one of the reasons why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents: every time we descover something new or we say something, they judge us or they begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas.
As I said, adolescents can be very confused and if there's one thing that gets under our skinn, it is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite.
That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of; the type of love that doesn't let us fall usleep at night.
Travalling by car is also much more convenient.
In conlcusion we can say that, from the standpoint of doctors and nurses, working abroad is a much better deal.
Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underound dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people. The new boxers could be even more at risk.
There are all sorts of proposals; lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn, ban punches to the head, headguards worn, or make fights shorter, as most of the serious injuries occur in the later rounds. These would all show off the boxers 'skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch.
However, such a rebellion cannot be seen clearly in each minority work, and, therefore, the products of ethnic American literature cannot be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression.
Emphasis changes with each work, and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple, other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters 'responsive action which the previously mentioned works show.
This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature cannot be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression, but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences.
Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and any occurence is for some good.
The supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged.
But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully intergrated with Europe.
In fact, in political, economic and defence terms, I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive.
Whilst, to a certain extent, I may be guilty of having an island mentality, I wouldn't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg.
This process will continue and Europe and the rest of the world will evolue with or without the participation of Britain in this process.
In relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers, the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage.
It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerancy.
These superpowers were economically, militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states.
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is sucessful depends very much on the people of Europe.
To remedy this, the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception.
The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic on the part of the road system obviously increases the risk of drivers having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic.
It might seem an easy soloution to this mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e. the railways.
People are not taking to the rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas.
Then people would be more likely to catch the train, as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk, wait for a bos or pay for an expensive taxi ride.
My soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services. This would get people off the roads and onto the trains.
To improove the rail service, trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times, i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six.
The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap, i.e. the same price as or less than it would cost to go by car.
The basic dilema facing the UK's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population.
Most large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport, thus decreasing major conjestion in rush hour periods.
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicular transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere, damaging the ozone layer, creating smog and forming acid rain. Tourturing the Earth we are living on.
To illistrate my point, if every time you took a train, it stopped for 2 hours on the track, everyone would stop taking it.
The most likely answer lies in 2 areas. Firstly, the attitude of many westerners is that it is their right to travel in such a mannor.
I am by far and away no 'greeny' who wants to make everyone live in tipee s and eat soya bean soup. However, I do agree that somthing should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today.
Do we, the westeren world (5% of the population of the world), have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at this environmental cost?
Just beause we cannot be bothered to get out of bed a bit earilene to catch public transport.
That could have disasterous implications.
The 2nd reason, is the promblem that the public transport service, for example rail, is declining so much; there is no train to catch in the morning.
This has now been intensified with the sale of the railways to privite rail companies, profit motivated.
The vital, small rail links may now be closed, whereas priviously they where subsudised to make up the loss. Now the privite companies cannot afford to do this, so many will close, cutting off small towns and villages.
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it, and the only people to do this is the government or ourselves. If we make the effort to use public transport, it will expand into a good service. Unfortunately, the public seem to be appethetic towards this idea.
Although it may sound cruel, I do not beleive that any fighter has entered a proffessional boxing career without knowing the risks.
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the 'sport' safer: having rungside doctors, banning bare hand fights, but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage.
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport, and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again at the forefront of discussion.
The family, who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport, would be leading the protests againt boxing.
This hypocritical view is shared by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future.
The lottery has also suffered alegations that it is addictive, especially with the introduction of scratch cards.
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their availiable cash on lottery tickets, only to be disappointed.
It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound recieved by the lottery goes to charitable causes. The rest is tax the prize fund, profits, and the so-called charities.
It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions, ie highly unlikely.
It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high. Most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot had runed their life, alenating them from friends and family.
In conclusion, I think that the lottery should be retained, but not in its present form. I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds, and the prize fund shared between more people: it is better to give forteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person.
I would also remove any American buisness interests and give the charity money to a more diserving 'charity'.
The most obvious example of this is the calculator, an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations.
The world watched in anticipation. We were mesmirized by the images of the TV, expecting something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it. I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school: "Have you heard?", "I can't believe it!", "After all this time!", "I never thought it would happen.
Bolstered by the Germans 'success, the people of Hungary, Tchekoslovaquia, Poland and Rumania rose against communist regimes as well. Now, three years later, communism as we once knew it no longer exists.
The repetion of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and, not only that, it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again.
Whether it be a kitchen knife used to stab someone, a car used to run someone over, or something as harmeless as a pillow used to suffocate.
Normally, more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy.
There are people who are agains this, saying it is not natural and asking is it fair to the child to have started life in a test tube, as they believe life starts from the moment of conception.
, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles, for example.
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie.
People in our modern times are now able to have liver, heart and even lung transplants. There are many complications but many are succesful.
The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed, and the baby is then inserted back into the mother.
The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally.
This idea is extremely benificial because married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children.
As the fetous begins its life in a test tube, and the sperm is selected, this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected.
The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSB.
This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal.
Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism, although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point about BSB.
Although British farmers have learned to diversits, dairy farming and the sale of beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain.
People throughout the United Kingdom were, doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalapthy, or BSE.
For beef to be repreived or condemned, we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked, and, more importantly, whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former.
This claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness.
As you can imagine, this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants, where beefburgers are the main item on the menu.
The answer to this question lies in one's feelings about Democracry.
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century, Women's Liberation has been met with adamant, and often obstinate oppostion.
This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists, made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild, disgruntled zealots and was, therfore, detrimental to the good of society.
Like many other aspects and movements in life, they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed at was not so jaded.
However, throughout the years, television has lost much of its integrety; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education.
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and dificulties.
Though it has probably been around for a while, it s presence hasn't really been known untill fairly recently, and it s consequences have been devistating.
AIDS has definately had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world, because it always leads to death and there is no cure.
As a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrations, the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana; from survival kits and basement bomb shelters to an ever-circulating cheif Executive command post from the air.
It was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally-occurring antibiotics through synthesis.
In part, it has created The Information Age, as the latter part of the 20th ctry is often labelled.
Presidents and dictators alike switch on the channel to recieve first-hand information from the network, such as impeachments, coups d'etat or civil wars.
40% of U.S. millionares are entertainers.
Unfortunately, the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversable.
The waters of the culunary seas had been calm and consistant for centuries.
Progress had moved slowly like the tides and the constant rythm of the waves showed little change.
However, with the dawn of the twentyth century, a storm brewed.
In an age where time is the scarcest comodity, our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen.
This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century.
Every morning I listen for the weather forcast and dress accordingly.
TV comercials and TV programs project models of how one should be.
People are more mobile, can work more, and buy more things, but time for relaxation and family are often substitued with TV. In America, this growing individualistic society, one no longer sees the realitive humanness between people, instead one sees the differences, the unlucky, the unsuccessfull, and attribute thier inability to achieve to a lack of effort.
There was a group of scholars in France, l'Academie Français, that set guidelines for French literature.
According to l'Academie Français, all literature of the Neoclassical period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics, including sex, violence, church, and state issues.
He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys, and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act.
