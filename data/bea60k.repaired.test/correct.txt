I was born in Xi 'an which is widely known as one of the oldest cities around the world, as many as 13 dynasties chose Xi' an as the capital city, which makes me proud.
Just several decades ago, rivers were completely available for swimming and fishing.
Now if I am qualified to change one thing here, I would love to change the environment here.
Xi 'an had experienced a really rapid industrial development during last 30 years. People's material demand have been highly satisfied.
Nowadays, when people don't have to worry about their livelihood, they unanimously find the environment here is much worse than they have imagined.
We have extremely hot summer, unbearable winter, dusty spring and gloomy autumn.
Currently if we keep doing this, undoubtedly this city will be turned into a place where no longer suitable for people to live, sequentially economic achievements will vanish into the air.
Once I'm fortunate enough to be qualified to change environment here, shutting inefficient factories, pouring money into improving air and water quality, vigorously encouraging environment conservative companies, cultivating environmental conscience among youngsters will firstly be done.

It's like when visiting a Japanese restaurant in Europe. The foods there tastes like Japanese food, but there's always be something that holds me back from calling it 'Japanese food'.
Maybe it's because the ingredients are not really the same even when I'm following the exact recipe from a website or a cook-book. Onions available in Japan are not the same as the ones in (from) Spain, of-course.

One of my classmates from college already got married last year. I feel a little surprised because it's only been two years since graduation and it's possible that their financial condition is not good enough for raising a family.

After getting married, they might have many problems that before could not have been imagined. Sometimes it will be difficult to get through it, but if two people love each other enough, they will finally solve the problem.
But every time this thought comes to my mind, I realize I would do just the same thing as them.

Children are given too much free time? Task4
Nowadays, some people might concern that children are given too much free time.
From my point of view, when they are given too much free time by school, they may spend more time on surfing the internet, playing computer games or watching TV, moreover, will probably do something which is not allowed under their age without a guardian.
It maybe not a good idea either, it will make studies become boring and tiring, yet the extra presures given were not necessary.
In my opinion about children's free time, I believe school is a good environment where student start their socail life and team work, including vairety of studying.
However, when they are out of school, they also should arrange their free time wisely to do other recreational activities instead of an axtra school work.

I heard that they often eat century eggs in Chinese restaurants in the Philippines from my Filipino teacher a little while ago.
Other people probably thought that I was mad, but I like that!
Today I gave an American guy a call through Skype, It is my frist time to use Skype and talk with a Chinesepod student.
I have had lots of students in the last four years, but I teach them face to face, so it's easy to know what they want to know and want to say.

So I relieved.

Although the rice was a little tough, it was so delicious.
However, the chief of our speech section said that his performance was too passionate/ exaggerated.
He told me that, while Japanese judges tend to demand speakers to deliver thier speech emotionally (?), foreign judges want speakers to deliver their speech naturally.
The chief said that his speech was too calm.
That really impressed me,
This thought crossed my mind.
I have to admit though, I do like the taste of meat.
I was really shocked that people can be that cruel.
``You have two choices, you can wait here until the electric power is restored, or you can finish now.
Three of my friends came to my house to study English together as usual this morning.

At times like this, to avoid misinterpretation and unnecessary panic, the Venusians consulted their Martian/ Venusian Phrase Dictionary.
She then attempts to help him by asking questions or talking about what she thinks the problem is.
I need you to ask me questions to assist me in discovering what is happening. ``At this point she proceeds to anger him by asking questions when he real wants to be left alone.

I must work and perform my experiment tomorrow morning.
However, I could not agree less. Based on the view that other training institutions (such as vocational colleges) are better suited to teach practical techniques, forcing universities to teach vocational courses would violate our freedom to choose our career path.
Because universities are not the only places that can provide employment preparation courses, but are the only places providing academic education.
Apparently, no other institution can replace universities 'ability to cultivate people in a particular academic field, and that is the main reason why people pay their tuition fees.
Moreover, universities are not the best place for practical skilled trainings. There are thousands of institutions and employers who can provide the more up-to-date training that the workforce needs to perform their jobs.
In sum, in comparison with universities, employers and other institutions are better-equipped and better-qualified to prepare people for the employment market.
The graphic of that was drawn by the famous Japanese designer who did the animation for ``Evangelion``.
It's Blues, which Clapton is always in, meets hip-hop rhythm style which is really comfortable enough for me to listen to it for about 10 years.

Hearing the explanations, I thought I understood,

This is the first time that I wrote a diary in English!
The face I saw was one of my friends who I hadn't seen for a couple of years.
But it was great time to make new friends and I leaned some good expressions from the teacher.

A charming smile appears and says 'are you ok?'.

Each candidate comes out with his own political manifesto to make the country better. However, depending on who is elected, everything will go on to be different from the way it is now, which will be enough to affect other countries all over the world.
Anyway, it is absolute that last night was an important day, so I thought that essentially everyone else was interested in the election.
Well, it is partially true but in fact, not everyone did take notice of it.
Tomorrow I have a Chemistry test 0. o I studied hard but I think I'll fail.
The children are the happiest.

So I wondered:
In Japan, we eat 'ozoni', which means mixed ingredients in soup, as a traditional custom during the New Year week.
^ ^; The New Year is supposed to be a holiday, but it's not a holiday for me.
For that, I should study grammar, words and phrases.
all of the world know that the chinese school uniform is too ugly.

Recently, we have been running up a big medical bill in Japan,
into practice to reduce medical expense.
This counselling is not compulsory.
In China students learn English from middle school to college, but, there are not many students who can learn English well. First our mindset is wrong. Some of them think that learnning English is a burden. To pass the exam is their only purpose.
Second, the big circumstance is so bad. It is very difficult for you to find people to communicate with you in English. Someone may think if one person got a high mark, his or herEnglish is very good. I do not think so. We all know that language is a tool that we can use to communicate with others.
The rapidity of memorization is fastening.
I went shopping at 10: 00 this morning,
Fortunately, South korea has developed accommodations called Jjim-jil-bang.
But today, goods for the Japanese New Year were on display.
Recently, I often thought that I would want to study English again.
I went to an English-speaking country and was been there for 7 years.
When I was overseas, I didn't watch English news channels or movies, I could not understand the popular programs, as I have no idea about their culture background.
I want to listen to, speak, write, and read English better than I do now.
I'm required to learn formal words rather than informal.
In my case, I'm exposed to formal situations most often.
During class or school, I would hardly have a chance to use slang.
But I am not a caterpillar, so I give up.
Since the bowl has become empty, finally you can eat an ordinary meal.
I never say ``Don't worry. its going to be alright`` to make them relax because I am a teacher.
Can you have a recommend a drama?
The night safari and taxi companies are friends or couples.
I am a brave man, but when we took a tram there, I sat beside a fat American couple because they possibly cannot run faster than me.
Probably they can't jump over it.
If they do so, does the safari pay a compensation to us?
So we had to take a taxi, and it was already over 00: 00 a. m..
The taxi fare cost DOUBLE.
I think that the night safari and all taxi companies are friends or couples.
I applied for an open position at my company.
There is a botanical garden there famous for wisterias.
However, the wisterias are not in full bloom. I enjoyed tbeautifull flowers and pleasant smells.

First, I'd like to introduce myself.
It was based onthe true story of someone's life, and we changed some part of the story.

Nobody could explain why it happened.
And so I guess some birds made a noise or hiccuped and dropped them.
I decided not to doubt it.
I miss you like as a friend who cooks with me, watches some movie and cries, smokes a cigarette and talks, talks about life or silly things.
The last time I saw you I couldn't hide that I wanted to cry because my confidence has gone.
I hope air heaters will become unnecessary.
but statistics is very difficult.
I am studying English at a university class now.

I am dog-tired and all of a sudden, I got a brain wave that may would take away my agony of the hot world, which technically has a big global warming issue.

Recently, I bought an iPad.
Last week I was watching a survey on a BBC TV program that was being broadcast while I was about to eat.
Suddenly the results showed something I didn't expect: only one in 10000 people had achieved their life-long goals.
My pieces of work were admired by my teachers and were the cause of envy of many of my classmates and other colleagues.
There was even a time when one of the most respected professors I had, Mr Smith, commented that my work, ``resembled that of the geniuses of the Renaissance period``.

In my thesis, I predicted the oil price was jumping due to speculation by investors and that this bubble would pop.
What I predicted was what exactly happened after one year.
Therefore, Oil became a target for investors at Wall street.
In the stock market, it does not usually happen, but oil fluctuates violently.
So investors who want to take advantage of this market are never ceasing.
But Oil is absolutely necessary for our life.
I don't know when alternative energy will be practical.
So oil has to be steadily supplied and should not be dealt with like loans and other financial products.

Although it seems a kind of poison, it must be a medicine; it is alcohol.
Some people believe drinking alcohol is not good for their health.
According to a health research institute, drinking has a positive effect on health.
While one drinks alcohol, they should be able to express inner thoughts that are usually not expressed.
However, people can get these kind of negative effects only when they exceed a moderate amount of alcohol.
When focusing only on the health effects of alcohol, there are no bad effects if one does not exceed their limit to accept alcohol
Consequently, expanding blood vessels and eliminating depression, which are healthy effects, can be brought about by drinking alcohol.

When you look up a word in this dictionary, it always gives you a clear definition of the word in a user-friendly layout.
I used to use a Japanese-English one (and admittedly still use it from time to time), but now I usually use the English-English one.

But that announcement is unacceptable.
There are many rumors about that on the net.
I read many articles and thought about it.
It's the device by which we can play games without buying software.
In the previous series, SQUIRE ENIX set up a provision against Majicon.

But I heard that the provision/ trap was broken in 6 hours after DQ was released and was published on net.
I think that SQUIRE ENIX is preparing for a complicated provision next time.

When a woman resists a man's solutions he feels his competence is being questioned.

Here are some brief examples of ways a man might mistakenly invalidate feelings and perceptions or offer unwanted solutions.
This is what you should do. ``
Each of these statements either invalidates or attempts to explain upset feelings or offers a solution designed suddenly to change her negative feelings to positive feelings.
By learning to listen, gradually he will experience that she will appreciate him more even when at first she is upset with him.

The cerebral wave activity is classified into groups, each one named with a Greek letter: Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Theta.
So, Alpha waves have a frequency of 0. 5 and 0. 4 cycles per second, and they are often found in a state of deep sleep.
Theta waves have a frequency of 5 and 7 cycles per second, and they are found in the state between wakefulness and dreaming.
Alpha waves have a frequency between 8 and 14 cycles per second, and they are found in states of peace and a relaxed alert.
Beta waves have a frequency of 15 and 22 cycles per second, and they are found in a state of crisis, anxiety and aggressiveness.
The massive production of Alpha waves in children makes them have a great learning capacity that can even allow them to attain/ achieve super-learning or accelerated learning when there is a state of peace.
On the other hand, if there is a state of aggressiveness or stress, learning cannot be achieved.

When the grown-up 1900 sat in front of the piano, using his slender hands; which are smooth like the keys, the ship bouncing on the sea waves, the piano's pulling and melodious tones, entranced by the music that he played for the poor people, my heart followed the tones up and down and the happiness on everyone's face.

Is this true? Everytime the boat draws into the shore, he looks at the island in a lonely way. He called strangers secretly with a nervous and expectant voice, ``hello, you don't know me, but, can we have a chat?``. Especially when that tramp told 1900 his experience. He wanted to experience standing on the island and listen to the sea. What would that be like? I'm not 1900, but I can definitely identify with his loneliness and longing-he was very keen to be on the island that he had never experienced.

It is regretful that I have not had such experiences, as I have studying English for so many years.
It is typical of Japanese students that they cannot speak nor write.

Naritasan is a famous temple in Japan.
There was TV program on about pyramidz.
I found TV programs about pyramids on the last day of last year too.
I wonder why there are so many about pyramids on new year's days in Japan.
But, as I watched them, I gradually became interested in pyramids!
Some day, I wanna (want to) go to Egypt and enter a pyramid!
Once more sad Middle Autumn!
Anyway, children will be sad if they will not be able to go out to join a lantern parade.

Tomorrow do it, ok? Then I didn't do it when tomorrow comes. Yes, I know I shouldn't delay what I should do tomorrow. But I can't obey it, It's strange. I really want to improve my english. And I know the way to improve English in my mind. But I don't follow it. So sometimes I hate myself. Why don't you do it? Why do you delay it to tomorrow? Why?
You can't do things like Aya. you promise you will do like the way Aya does. but you break it. it's so terrible. But I don't know why I can't. Every day I want to be better. I study hard to catch up with my classmates, I think that they are really great. I must study hard to overtake them. and I do it im my own way. Every day I study English until about 12 o 'clock.
I review my subject. I do lessons carefully. I hope I can catch up with them through my hard work. I know it can't be called ``hard``, in another's mind, it's a ordinary life, can't be called ``hard``. As for me, I think so, but if I stay up too late, I'll feel too lethargic to have lessons. It's my weakness as well as laziness.

In the article, this kind of thing is written: ``this story is like Anne Frank falling in love with a Nazi officer.`` It means that this kind of love can never happen between a new settler from England and a Native American.
I want to study languages by chatting with people on my computer and I searched for a website like that.
'Maria' wanted an option of replying to comments to be implemented, with which I strongly agreed, and she encouraged us to use 'native nod' function more to confirm the other natives 'correction would be right or fair.

Because many japanese students including me study just for college.
Although they still don't know what they wanna be or what they can do, they have to decide what their major will be beforehand. But I think that's ridiculous.
After I entered college, I found out many things that I should have noticed when I was in high school.

That is because foreign people can't come this univ if they do not have much money and considering the living standard of Chinese people, ordinarily could not come.
However, many Japanese people, including myself, have several complicated feelings concerning Chinese people, because the Chinese response to Japan is unacceptable to the Japanese mind. Of course this does not apply to all Japanese people; but it is a pity that some of them it does actually apply to some of them.
Therefore I will end my comment.

Back to the work topic, there are some difficulties. First, the junior of my team doesn't work hardly, and is less patient.

By the way Most Japanese people have learned English for more than six years.
We think so too.
But Unfortunately, Japanese people don't have many opportunities to use English everyday.
If people start noticing that learning English is for communication with all over the world, population of people who can use English will increase, I think.
In particular, in Japan, we are well on the way to an aging society more and more.
The Japan national soccer team won the game against Australia and have now advanced to hopefully become the Asia Cup champions.

The fourth member of the platoon is Kururu. He is a mad scientist, and he likes bothering people. He's a pervert. Finally we have Dororo, an econinja. He came to conquer the planet, but when he saw the beauty of it, he decided to save it. He is always forgotten by the platoon. Poor Dororo ahahah! (haha)
I should have gone back to home at midnight, but the airplane was delayed.

Hello, my friends. First of all, I want to apologize to all my friends at lang-8 for being absent for this long period due to the requirements in my last year of college. No doubt that I miss you all. I pick up this topic because everybody here is talking about the referendum in sudan these days. To the people who don't know much about Sudan, it is the biggest country in Africa and located on east side of Africa; south of Egypt. My country has struggled with political instability and prolonged wars since being liberated from the British 50 years ago. Unfortunately Sudan was born with wars and the most harmful one was in South Sudan. That war is considered the longest war in the history of Africa or modern history. The war continued 50 years after liberation, killed two million Sudanese citizens, and caused four million Sudanese citizens to emigrate due to the paralyzed economy we had during this ugly war.
Sudan is a country of different races, languages, and religions, but specific parts in the north are more educated than other parts of Sudan. This is because during British rule the south and west of Sudan were closed areas and the government didn't allow any cultural developmental. So, soon after liberation the Sudanese found themselves with big challenge of how to rule this wide country where the north Sudanese were more educated. The government was ruled by them and other citizens felt like this government doesn't represent them. The biggest historical mistake is that this government did not change British policy of closed lands. As result of this huge mistake, the racism grew between Sudanese populations and rapidly the southern Sudanese took up arms to get their rights in Sudan. At that point, no Sudanese, including southern Sudanese, had the idea for a separation. They just wanted their rights in their country as whole Sudan. And, as days go by, and wars burned houses and killed children and women, the idea of separation from Sudan arose. In 2005, the happiest year of Sudanese history, the government and (splm) stopped the war in South Sudan the Nifasha Peace Agreement has born. The government promised a lot political changes: the system became democratic and a successful election also occurred. Southern Sudanese can rule their own lands by the new federal system. In the Nifasha Peace Agreement, the government sponsored the referendum right after six years of the treaty. This period was supposed to be the rehabilitation period of the wars affect on the south. The south took more than 50 percent of the oil to rehabilitate southern Sudan by SPLA. Due to the bad situation in the south and huge corruption, not many changes took place in health and education and most of the money was spent on south Sudanese army. Due to the environment which lacks any trust, now the 6 years is running out fast and the Sudanese face a referendum one month from now. The news is not good about the south, because a lot of politicians see the separation as the start of a new phase of war in Sudan because most of the oil in Sudan lies in the boundaries between south and north. And these boundaries have not been defined yet, so the Sudanese are worried about witnessing another endless war. The situation is very tense and everybody is expecting the worst, but there is hope that the referendum will lead to unity. And if that occurs, it will be the true liberation of Sudan and a promising future. We pray for our children to be raised in a united Sudan without bloodshed.

The foremost reason for dwelling in the countryside is the soothing and comfortable life provided by the pastoral view.
Those who have enjoyed the first cock crow in the morning, the twittering of birds in the trees and the breathtaking sight of the rising sun would go into rapture at only the mere mention of the idyllic life.
Relaxed and suburban dwellers are able to hold a more positive attitude for life and achieve more accomplishments.
Another subtle explanation rests on the fact that country inhabitants are fortunate enough to enjoy the cozy and pleasant ambiance of the family without exhausting their social life.
On the contrary, it would be far more difficult to acquire such pleasure for those urbanites.
Naturally, it is possibly too reckless to assert that nothing beneficial comes from city life since several accompanying merits also come along with it.

Using public transport can be difficult, because we have a strict time and, normally, we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely uncomfortable.
One argument for not using the car is that petrol is very expensive, but public transport tickets are also increasing, so that advantage is not so good, actually.
The story took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by doctors and scientists.

Thank you for your attention, and I'll wait for your advice, (this is my first time writing over 50 words)

This summer was the best. I went to Cuchilla Alta with my best friends. Their names are: Emilia, Agustina, Micaela and Lucía.
I like English because it is very important to know other languages to communicate with other people and if I go to another country it is very important to know English.
We got to work at four in the afternoon and it was very relaxing. I had a day off when I spent time at home or going to the gym, where I met handsome guys.
You see, man, I don't like crowded roads, a nd prefer to travel by tram.
The development of the railroad and highway are easy to pulished, but the construction of seaports and airports must with congenital condition.
I rather enjoy spinning, feeling the rhythm of the music louder and louder. This gives me high energy each time I go spinning.
To conclude, in bigger cities like Bern or Zurich there is no doubt that the public transport system would be less inconvenient than travelling by car.
First, the bank notes are considered how to design, including background colour, artwork and security issues.
Then, they are prepared by skilled machinists.
If the sheets are good, those sheets are then cut into separate bank notes and packed into cars in order to be dispatched all over the city.
I believe that using your car has a lot of advantages or benefits. It is more comfortable and less expensive.
Yoga calms and vitalizes body and mind.
And government, please don't be so flabby with your own citizen.
For beginners in this sport I would recommend that a trainer teaches swimming properly because it is very important to pay attention to the position of the arms.
May Maybe they are comfortable, terrible,, dangerous or average.
Cars and buses become dangerous and cause problems in the street.
She turned her head and saw him. "He was following me", she thought. "Well, I should ask him what he is doing here".
First of all, finishing high school is a rite of passage that indicates the beginning of a new chapter for students.
When you are travelling around the world by yourself, you gain a lot of knowledge, culture, discoveries and, with all of this, you gain personal experience.
The job provides, like the trip, responsibility and experience.
The consequences aren't good as the reasons, for instance, they may have the career prejudicate, or they spend so many years travelling that they are too old to study at a university.
Besides that, they have different points of view on many subjects, that is why they may not like the fun and the conversation in the social life with other students.
They cannot enjoy this chapter with young and fresh thoughts.
It is a big decision, that brings great consequences and great experiences.
As an example, if a student needs to recuperate a subject or has to get a good mark, they can't go to do a sport because there is no time.
They would consider you as an independent person.
Accordingly, you would take responsibility for what you did.
I am overwhelmed with grief, living with them.
Eating habits in my country have really changed in the last ten years.
it's r isn't clear completely, but I suppose it depends on changing life habits in the development process of our society.
But a good change in our habits is the attention to calories and healthy food, because of getting information on the internet and other media that are easily accessible for all people these days.
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he had forgotten what he had to do. After thinking, he remembered that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her in his car as the doctor's clinic was far away from her house. Peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother's house in the next street. After he arrived, he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the street. He apologized to her and asked her to get into the car. "Never mind" she said and got in the car beside him.
However, travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine. Travelling by bus is not as convenient as getting in a car, but you can never know what might happen with your car, where it might get stuck in traffic or some other accident might happen.
Travel plans need to depend on public transport timetables.
Besides, Hong Kong also has many country parks for hiking.
Tom is studying in London.
Although Canada is an English-speaking country, in Montreal, the official language is French.
So I do not have the opportunity to practise English, because most of my colleagues speak French.
I was inspired by a true legend. His name is Edan Hazard.
That fact behind sense because the maintenance of public transport is not the responsibility of the traveler.
If we want to count function of public transport because it's not enough words to say. But public transport is a much needed service in big cities as well as small villages.
I'm sure you'll agree that Red Square is the most popular sight in the capital of Russia.
I remember two contrasting moments. One day, we had to create a team to do an exercise which used the brain; they chose me.
The reasons for stress are more diverse; perhaps because we have an exam period, family problems or because we think in a negative way, or we have destroyed ourselves through long hours of working and canceld our needs for enough comfort, and lots of reasons to stress...
We must get rid of the stress quickly before we lose ourselves, because it's very harmful. For example, you can read a book, do sport, play music, eat delicious food, remember all the positive things that have happened to you, talk with someone who you trust, get rid of everything that makes you upset and makes your life tiring, go out and eat a meal with your best friends, and there are a lot of things you can do...
Remember that stress is not a lasting thing, and you can avoid it.
In other words, both bad sheets and the ones which are separated badly need destroying in a safe way which can stop them from getting into the market.
Many people believe that nowadays there is no future for public transport, because travelling by car is so much more convenient, but others continue with the thought that they do help, for example, with travelling long distances.
The ticket doesn't cost too much and it is affordable for the majority of people, at least compared to buying a car.
Secondly, public transport is more efficient for travelling long distance than cars and people wouldn't have to purchase fuel.
When people need to travel to other continents or far away, they may need a plane, which is a form of public transport, to complete the journey because they have to cross oceans and complicated distances that have different landforms.
However, a car is something which belongs to the person and he can do whatever he wants and find it in the same state he left it in, and sometimes public transport vehicles aren't left in the best way.
In addition, you have to share with people you absolutely don't know and probably won't see again.
But, by observing all these people, you can enrich yourself with the different cultures and manners the others have and incorporate new topics.
That was my first time on holiday in another country that wasn't northern Italy.
We visited a lot of monuments, museums and churches, like the Louvre with the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci.
It depends on five main steps, which include design, preparation of metal plates, printing, inspection, packaging and destruction or disposal depending on whether the fourth step is good or bad.
Secondly, we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinists.
If it's good, they go to packing and distribution, whereas the others should be destroyed as well.
In conclusion, the whole process is an unreversed schedule.
It cosumemed the power which includes humans and machines.
To begin with is design, we have to consider background colour, artwork, and security issues, and then we are supposed to prepare metal plates, using skilled machinists.
Secondly, printing-- including sheets of bank notes, are printed (50 bank notes per sheet). There are some requirements-- colour on both sides, special ink, slightly raised images.
Finally, if it is a good sheet, the procedure is packaging and distribution, including cutting into separate bank notes, packing, dispatching.
If it is a bad sheet, the procedure is disposal-- bad sheets and bank notes should be securely destroyed.
And then he realised it was an enormous lion.
But suddenly he heard a noise, it was his mum. "Max where are you?" she screamed. The lion disappeared in one second, running.
Max spent the rest of the day thinking about that lion until he went into his room. "What an amazing day!",
The most difficult area in English I have trouble with is writing.
I have no problems with reading, speaking or listening.
As part of my plan to improve my English skills, I decided to search on the internet for any free program which could help me with the plan to improve my English writing.
Trieste is a little town situated in the north-east of Italy.
So the environmental impact is very attractive.
Another problem is that the citizens of Trieste don't pay attention to the environmental problems of their city.
I think it is important that, not only in the family, but also in school, we could raise a new generation sensitive to the ecological problems of the earth.
I usually go two days a week but next month I am going to go three or four days a week because I hope to enter a local competition.
It turned out that that young boy had a good head for fishing and now they always go fishing together.
I like running, riding my bike, playing football, skiing in winter, climbing, etc.
I like football because it is a sport that I have played since I was small and I think that it is the most fun and exciting team sport.
The amount of garbage is increasing at the same time as the number of humans is increasing.
The growth of consumption in developing countries leads to increasing consumption of energy, water and other resources.
Nowadays, our local government is making some decisions to improve the situation.
There are a lot of citizens movement except official activities.
People organise common action for cleaning areas near houses.
These activities take place especially in spring and in autumn.
Everyone is curious about making bank notes.
The bank notes are designed carefully. Workers need to design their background colour and artwork.
Then, the notes will be prepared on metal plates. After that, printing. The notes will be printed in colour on both sides with special ink and they will have slightly raised images.
Good ones will be packaged and distributed. workers will cut them and deal with them carefully.
The rest of them will be disposed of.
I think that Cádiz is the perfect place to meet, because Cádiz has coast, sea, and mountains.
In Cádiz, in summer, there are a lot of opportunities to work.
I hope I will get my order and I hope you will be more on time for the customer order shipping.
These people can influence our lives. For example, if you have bad friends you become a bad person and you will have problems in your life. So, your education depends on the people around you.
In general, people have the possibility to study in libraries or using computers.
Personally, I think studying on a computer is a better choice.
We need to do something to save the world!
I think they are our first friends and our first confidants.
Think about a family's routine.
The Brazil and Netherlands games were a real test of our health.
And I think that it's not technology that will change, but the people and their characters.
Unfortunately, for this generation, there won't be real relationships, all relationships will become virtual relationships.
According to my experience, if we don't exaggerate the way we use technology like the internet, phone, satellite.
For example, now high-heeled shoes are very trendy but they cost a lot and most women don't look good in them.
Transportation is one of the most essential parts of our day to day life; whether it is public or private, transport takes the same priority in each person's life from the very early days.
In the age before industrialisation came into existence, people also used various alternatives to travel from one place to another.
Then the technology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to make the transport more convenient.
Continuing my visit to London, I will visit the largest park in London, Hyde Park, which has a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for the preservation of the park.
follow in London I'll go for a walk to get to Big Ben, which is the most beautiful building in all its splendour, where I will take pictures.
Later, I'll take the London Underground, which is a public fast transit system. I'll travel on it.
My favorite band is "cbjr"; it's a Brazilian band. The type of music is rock and rap. Their music is very easy to single.
I usually play it with my friends.
We won 1st place and got the cup. If anyone intends to play this game, he should practise hard to be able to play it professionally.
To sum up, I think it is inevitable.
He loved Rose with his entire soul, a soul that he was losing.
Suddenly, he took the agreement and signed the piece of paper with his blood.
Do you know a new recipe for cooking chicken?
Our town takes care of the environment of our neighbourhood very seriously.
Not only the supermarket has these containers. They are also in the schools of the neighbourhood.
In my opinion, this gives a good example of the involvement of the local government.
The majority of people visiting Katowice are focused on three things: souvenirs, fashion and food.
Fortunately, visitors will find all of that in the Tourist Information Office and in shops on the outskirts.
So, he is hard-working. He is a lawyer and always helps me with all my professional problems.
However, a few years ago, the government has paid more attention to the environment of our country. For example, they did a lot of advertising on television, in newspapers and on the internet to explain that rubbish is not good for our world.
In the castle there is the Holy Trinity Chapel.
The famous dish of this restaurant is a huge hamburger.
So, train is an intermidiate way to travel.
I am writing to apply for the job in the USA published in an advertisement last Monday.
Additionally, because public transport is expensive and does not have a comprehensive coverage of most cities, private cars are more attractive for most people.
Some people say that a trip by car is more convenient than by public transport, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.
But public transport has a future for a lot of reasons. First, time. If the place you want to reach is really far, the different types of vehicles of public transport will get you there faster than your car. Also, the complications about the field, like if you want to go from America to Europe, there is no highway that crosses the ocean. You need an airplane and, unless you have one, you will not be able to achieve travel between continents with your car. A different reason is politics, because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska, you will not need to pass through Canada. Comfort is a really important reason, because driving for 8 hours is exhausting and it will also be unsafe. Economics is a factor too, because the wear and tear on your car will be more than in normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do. It will be more expensive than on public transport.
In conclusion, for me, it is a lie that public transport has no future. However, they have to make improvements to this, like the use of better types of fuel or energy. One way is using renewable sources of energy, such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hydraulic(water),Also, there are biodiesel and gasoline extracted from seaweed.
Dear Anne, Thank for your letter asking about my family and my friends.
When somebody gets home, he wants only to relax in front of the television.
Besides this, TV companies have understood sports provide this relaxing moment, mainly for men.
In this view, I think that though there are lots of sports on television, there are not too many, because people have looke for it.
When the day came, we performed an amazing choreography and we went back home with 3 gold medals.
This American band is known for their lyrics that something different from other bands, something close to an emotional statement.
My teacher said that public transport has no future in our society, because travelling by car is so much more convenient. Nevertheless, I disagree with her opinion because if we use public transport we will pollute less.
Without travelling, people would be very bored, life would be very monotonous.
Nowadays people use cars a lot.
In the past, it wasn't like that. People did not have cars. They just relied on public transport.
There are a few people who use public transport, like students and people who have a low income. In my view, I can say the public transport might be going to e close because nobody is going to beclose
He has been done several laws again Spanish citizens.
I have been playing this sport since twelve years ago. This sport has taught me to respect others and not to assault them.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is that I don't want to be weak. I wouldn't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule: the strong dominate the weak. When I step foot in the gym, I forget everything: school, home.... Therefore, I enjoy it.
Humans are looking for power and they apply the law of the jungle, the strongest beat the weakest.
What are the criteria of this ranking? and...
Chemical drugs can help people to heal and recover from diseases, but they have another hidden effect.
Therefore, The aforementioned information above shows that our future could be worse than our present.
We should live in a stable and peaceful world.
Nowadays, people use their cars to travel for work, for holidays...... but if the petrol were cheaper, they could travel a lot.
After the preparing of metal plates by skilled machinists, they take sheets of bank notes. There are three requirements for this: colour on both sides, special ink and images that are slightly raised.
It smelled terrific, and tasted so good.
It was pancakes and egg with bacon.
After that I played with my brothers out in the garden.
They usually don't want to be with me, but today we played all day long.
It was such fun and I couldn't stop smiling.
He told us that he was really embarrassed about what had happened and he apologised for his attitude.
It will not be trendy because everybody will have his own car.
There are advantages and disadvantages; television can also cause a dependence, cartoons and "stupid" programs can harm young people most.
Today, there are many children that have a dependence on television, they prefer to stay at home to watch the various children's TV programs, while once our parents preferred hanging out with their friends.
Television can be a useful instrument if it is used with caution. Therefore, I recommend using it less to prevent damage to the mind.
In order to help reduce pollution, I take action using the three "Rs": reduce, reuse and recycle, so I am more and more eco-friendly.
I reduce the use of unnecesary power at home. In other words, I turn on a light that I need while I use it; I take cooler showers; I heat only the necessary rooms.
In order to reuse, I convert all things reusable, for example, a plastic bottle as a plant pot; a glass bottle as a food container. I take my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a plastic shopping bag if a salesman offers me one.
A car is less expensive, more comfortable, faster and safer.
For example, travelling by train is cheaper and travelling by plane is faster.
On the other hand, it helps to reduce the pollution made by cars,..
The picture illustrate the process of making notes.
Then, preparation of the metal plates and skilled machinists are needed.
If the printed sheets are good quality, they will be packed and distributed. Some partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate or packed or dispatched. The bad sheets will be disposed on. The destruction will be secure.
So it is not always a good thing, unless they are open-minded or have their own methods to punish you in a gentle way that won't make you regret telling them your faults or mistakes.
I felt that I could lose consciousness. That's why I removed the bracelet.
I am glad to hear from you.
I am 24 years old. I am from Lviv Ukraine.
My hobbies are football and gym.
I am studying environmental science.
Now, to answer your question, I have many favourite places near my town because I live in a lovely little town, but there is one place that is special to me: 'A Fervenza do Pedregal'. '
It is a very quiet place. Because of its location, in the middle of the forest, only a few people know how to get there.
It is an incredible forest, the ground is covered in low grass and there is a little river where you can swim. It is the perfect place to have a quiet day.
That is all I can tell you about this place. I hope that my answer will help you with your project.
What is your last name?
I say to people that want to try this sport that it 's easy if you love it.
If you try this sport in the wrong way you could have health problems. For example, you could have problems with your hands, in your neck and in your legs.
Emily knew she would have to come to a decision soon.
The problem for Emily was that her boyfriend was as cold as the weather.
She thought he was so boring, but she didn't want to be alone. she didn't know how to live on her own and Emily was utterly terrified of being alone.
The purpose of this report is to make people more aware of the importance of taking care of the environment in order to eradicate this problem which has serious consequences nowadays.
The council is carrying out a project in order to eradicate rubbish from my town.
Combating the destruction of the environment, this is a serious problem throughout the world.
Nowadays, many trees and grassland areas are damaged in many countries, lots of building are constructed.
And people should pay attention to this problem and try to solve it.
For instance, people need too many places to build the modern society, so they cut down lots of trees, burning many grassland areas.
Another factor is that the animals do not control themselves and eat the plants leading to the destruction of the ecosystem.
Although this change makes the life of people efficient, the problem should not be ignored.
It would really be helpful if the government made tighter restrictions. In today's world, there are lots of construction companies and factories are not admission, they are destroying the forest, farmland and wetland, discharging waste water and emitting greenhouse gas. It leads to a serious environmental problem.
Taking the train is more cost effective than taking a car to work, as petrol is costly and the new transportation office has reduced the cost of tickets to assist with the daily living expenses we encounter.
The other benefit of taking public transport is fewer people are taking cars, reducing the amount of toxic gases released into the environment.
Karate is one of the best sports I have ever enjoyed in my life. One of the reasons behind my passion for karate is that it's a means of taming the mind and the body.
I have learned to get control of myself when someone teases me, and to be alert as well. Also, it helps me to always look slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well. People who want to start doing karate have to be patient.
They should immerse themselves in daily exercise as well as eat healthy meals to keep them active. for instance, it's advised to eat large amounts of fruits and fresh vegetables because they contain a lot of vitamins that the body needs to work properly.
My favorite sports are football, basketball, Formula One and Tennis.
For example, in our country, "Shinkansen" which means bullet train, is famous and very fast.
"Blue train", which has many beds on the train and we can sleep comfortably on the train.
Second, travelling by train is safe and reasonable compared to planes.
Travelling by train is cheep and getting a ticket is easy for us in our country.
And terrorism is scarce also.
A plane which was travelling from Egypt to Russia was exploded by terrorists last month.
What did you do yesterday?
I'm nineteen years old and from this city but living in a dormitory at Ton Duc Thang university.
When I am running, all the pressure I felt is gone.
We have Earth first, then people, than our house.
Earth is our home, we all have to protect it.
But now people are destroying it.
Just for money for more houses, but if we destroy it, we will all die. Our money will be gone, our house will be gone, we will have nothing.
Besides, some people destroy farmland to build houses, but if one day there is no farmland, then what should we eat? Nothing at that time. We couldn't eat anything!So what should we do?
So my idea is that all the countries and all the people stop using farmland, forests and wetland to build houses, grow more trees, protect our world, our home star!
The lecturer disagrees with the paragraph suggesting that the mentioned test developed by Alan Turing does not answer the main question: Can a computer think?
First, the lecturer talks about "Saran", who proposed a challenge to prove that Turing's test was not conclusive, and that he created a paradox.
He selected people to go into a Chinese room. There was a computer in the Chinese language with different symbols. The Americans showed different behavior. They did not understand what was on the computer screen.
Science, I just remember I have always liked motor racing, but one of my favourites is Formula 1.
The Formula 1 season starts in early spring and ends in late autumn.
I try to watch every race every fortnight and the training the day before the race.
Ferrari make one of the fastest cars in the world, but this season they are not so fast on the Formula 1 track as they were in the past.
If someone likes cars, then they should go to Formula 1 races to hear the bolid engine sound. I think that is the best sound I have ever heard in my life.
One day, the son of Lucy and her husband went to carve holes in the dirt to make a game, he made five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewel that had belonged to generations of gods. So he started throwing that for fun. One time that he took the jewel, it consumed the mind of the little guy and that made the jewel emit some sounds that only giants could hear, so a mountain stood up that was the face of a giant and he perceived negative vibes, so he killed the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods.
I hope you enjoy your trip to Seoul till you left our country.
England doesn't have anything. You are the worst and most horrible country in the universe.
With reference to the recent advertisement about 'USA CAMP SUMMER', I would like to express my interest in the position in the camp.
I think I am a suitable candidate for this job, because I like children and I have experience of babysitting. Also, I work very well at making food.
It was presented by a politician, an economist and two environmentalists.
Teens should not drink under the legal drinking age because they could get into trouble with the law, they could cause harm to themselves and others and could have a higher risk of alcohol dependency later in their lives.
This is an interesting question because I believe that my family are my best friends, but at the same time, they are not my friends.
My family are my best friends because they really take care of me when I need them to.
I started this sport when I was 10 years old. where My father was also playing this sport, but he started it when he was older than me. He was about 30 years old. where Squash is one of those games that can be played at any age. I love this game because I find it exercises the whole body at the same time. We run in a small space, moving our hands in stretched and different ways, and at the same time we work our minds, so it needs care and quick thinking, as much any as exercise you will find down the road.
I think that anyone who wants to start a doing sport should play squash, which gives a you flexible and healthy body. At the same time, this sport can be played for a long period of time without caring about age.
I have practised swimming for 3 years. I am a good swimmer and I have competed in different swimming tournaments.
My favorite swimmer is Michael Phelps because he was the best swimmer in the world, and I hope that he returns to the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.
My favorite style is the butterfly and I always practise this style because I want to improve.
Although public transport is cheap and more environmentally friendly, it is not as flexible or comfortable as the car.
Except for in the big cities, public transport is not an easy way to get around the city. That means that in the future even more people will stop using it.
In the first step, the bank notes have to be designed considering some, like background color, artwork and security issues. After the design has been prepared, skilled machinists prepare metal plates in the second step.
And then, some sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets which are cut into individual bank notes and separated into equal ones and packed and despatched to where they are needed.
In today's class, we were discussing whether or not we agree with the often enormous salaries of football players.
For me, as a passionate soccer player, it is a good point to consider.
I recommend to the clubs, be warned.
By this action a Ronaldo or Messie can be paid and it is possible to buy the best team for the league, like Bayern Munich is doing at the moment.
This makes football or soccer ever more exclusive to a certain group of fans-hooligans.
But if the prices are too high, no one will visit the games anymore.
First, I think that this job is perfect for me because I have travelled around the world and I know a lot of different kinds of food. In fact, on my last trip to Japan I learned to cook sushi.
One day, Michael wanted to go out, so he called his best friend and suggested going out together. His friend agreed, so Michael put on his clothes, went out and closed the door, but at that moment he knew he had made a mistake.
When he got back home, it was late and the meeting was canceled.
I know that I am a suitable person for this job, and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job, because I have travelled all over the world and during this experience, I have seen the necessity of work to finance my journey, so then I have dedicated myself to working on summer camps, and I have a lot of experience of this.
So, in conclusion, I think that if you contract me, you will get an excellent person and an excellent worker.
In my opinion, public transport is more expensive and it is less comfortable than a car, because a car is faster than public transport.
Online Learning
Positive things about online learning are that you are more mobile with your smartphone and you don't have to carry so much paper with you. Also, you're on your own and at your own learning speed, which makes it more specific to the user themself. Maybe you're more comfortable on your Smartphone than with paper.
Negatives about online learning are that you're not listening to much from a real person and more from a Computer. If pyou don't have any listening things in the app you don't learn how to pronounce the words. In my personal opinion, its better to learn from a teacher not only because you learn to pronounce the words correctly, but you also learn from a person, which is, in my opinion, way better. I think we spend enough time on smartphones, so I don't think it's the best if we use them to learn as well.
For words, I think it's perfect, but all the grammar and talking, I think you need a teacher.
The advertisements are a bit tricky because they know exactly when children watch, for example, after school.
Recently, there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building houses, which accour for some debate.
Apparently, it is a good thing, because it is a significant symbol of the development of a country; however, on the other hand, doing large-scale building projects may bring a galaxy of problems.
In a word, the government should appeal to people in some way, that we should protect the earth rather than only focus on personal profit.
It happened to me once and was very uncomfortable.
Another very common risk is falling on the court, which can cause dangerous scratches.
It is very nice that you remember me.
All this started in July.
I needed money which I could spend during my study semester.
I know that you are like me.
Best wishes your bro Bartek!
In later times, society felt the need for change because of iniquities that were committed in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes, the building was abandoned because the government and country didn't have money for construction, to the point that the building's metal structure was used for weapons.
They even asked me who I wanted to go with. They grabbed my hands, wanted me to go with them, but I had no idea, because I love my mother and my father so much.
Finally, I cried, because I couldn't make a choice. My father and my mother saw me crying and decided not to keep going, and they said sorry to each other and me.
Nowadays, I usually go back to the swimming pool at the weekends.
"So many friends learned to swim.
Then, the metal plates are prepared by skilled machinists.
The next is called partially damaged sheets, and bank notes are separated into good and bad. Good sheets will be cut into separate bank notes and packed; the bad ones will be destroyed by fire.
This is the method of making bank notes, and the operator should pay attention to the printed sheets and how to inspect them.
The most important step is the inspection by hand. That is to say, they should be separated into good ones, which are to be cut into bank notes and delivered to the banks, and the bad ones, which can't be utilised and are burnt securely in the last stage.
Actually, I realize that business is not for the major, everybody knows Tec is very demanding and if you want to be there, you must work hard.
I dream of being a Business Administrator when I'm older. First, I want to work for a sports company like UA and then I may have a little variety on works.
Tennis. Tennis is not just a sport anyone can play, but it's a professional sport and it needs more hard training and more time to be perfect at it. First, why did I choose tennis? Seriously, in 2003 it was my first time watching the game on TV when I saw Roger Federer play. I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to his professional movement when playing the ball. From that time, I was interested in this game and watching all the championships, so more time, time and time it is my favourite sport.
Aisha is in her thirties.

My favourite sport is football. I love it so much. When I was young, I used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona. I used to play with my friends in the street and we were so happy doing that, and after that, we played on a football pitch like in real football. I love Cristiano Ronaldo so much. He is the best player in the world. A few people have told me that Messi is the best player, but I feel angry when I hear that, because that is not true. So I am looking forward to meeting my favourite player one day. It's like a dream for me.

Above all, they talked more. We live in the era of telecommunication and no one could live without their mobile phone or their computer.
Moreover, also, simple things have changed. For example, the food we eat. Some time ago, everything was natural, healthy... but now everyone always eats "junk food" and things like that, which are completely unhealthy!
About food, I imagine a future society in which restaurants won't exist. People will eat only junk food and food which has been prepared before, food in tins... so all unhealthy things, which will cause many problems.
But phobias are fears which we experience that are life-threatening and they can disrupt everyday life, but people can get over them with the right sort of therapy.

Secondly, public transport is more ecological and less polluting for the environment, because it produces less polluting emissions, and many public vehicles use green energy, such as electricity or gas.
In conclusion, from my point of view, public transport is more necessary now than ever before. Cities contain more automobiles and the pollution is worse .We need to change our way of thinking, and try to use public transport as an alternative to improve the environment of our cities.

The public transport most used in Toluca is the bus because it is the cheapest, but it is very bad and unsafe. The quality of it is very bad; the buses are old and obsolete, they have broken windows and old broken seats.
The service is very bad. The drivers are very angry and stressed out so they do not drive with caution. In Toluca there are reports of high numbers of accidents involving buses.
I think if the government do the best work about the transport, they can save it.
It is true a car is more comfortable, but it uses a lot of mineral resources like petrol which can pollute the atmosphere.
I don't think public transport does not have a future. There are a lot of people who cannot buy a car and they have to use community transport.
The Internet is a useful tool for everyone, so we are communicating with distant friends, and we look for important information when we are studying or entertaining ourselves.
First of all, I am going to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of this topic.
The first advantage is that the Internet is very fast. For example, when you want information about something.
The second advantage is that the Internet by websites, such as Twitter, Facebook... You can speak with your quick friend, or you can meet with them on the website. Therefore, you do not call them on the telephone, because the internet is very cheap.
As for disadvantages, at present, children are always playing with their computer games and mobile phones.
To sum up, the Internet is the most important advance in the world, but there are a lot disadvantages and advantages.
From my point of view, the Internet is useful for everyone, but we should not abuse it, and should carry out other activities.

In particular, some people don't have a car and some elderly people find it difficult to drive a car by themselves, so public transport helps them a lot.

Nowadays, technology is more modern than in the past and people are always developing their inventions to make them more useful.
We as humans living in these days, rely on technology. Every aspect of our lives is supported by technology.
One example is television. In the past, we used it only for watching the news and movies, but as time goes by and the technology develops, now television has other functions.
Second, these days, television has become modern and that means television can be connected with the internet.
In conclusion, television can entertain and also educate, because television programs do it in an interesting way.

Then the sheets of bank notes are printed. Printing colour on both sides and use special ink and the images are slightly raised.
Finally, they find good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheets or bad sheets.
At the same time, bad sheets and bank notes are securely destroyed.
The other reason for my opinion is that almost all people prefer using the eyes and ears to other people, rather than write and listen to understand new things.

Once a day Sarah made a challenge to Michael about who could enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out of the other hole on the shore, but Michael was afraid.

As we are fully dependant on individual generators, these are causing multiple problems with the weather due to their smoke, oil and gas left behind, in addition to noise, of course, because they are the main source of the 18 continuous hours of noise.

Other residential areas, using their potential to maintain the environment by planting trees, roses, have numerous green spaces.
Also, recycling the trushes is a very intelligent way to keep the town clean and get multiple uses out of the products in industry lines.

In the village where I live, there is a lot of vegetation. For that reason, we try to protect the environment. One of the things we do is to do maintenance every week to the vegetation zone, checking if there is any garbage. To avoid this, we teach the younger generation environmentalist actions so they don't throw cans, paper, or candies on the floor. They can also help the older people. There are cases where a person throws garbage on the street or on the vegetation. To avoid that happening again, we have a punishment that is to pay some money. If they don't, they won't be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again, unless they are visitors. In that case, we tell him or her the way we live in the village and, we give him or her advice to keep a beautiful place without garbage.
Another environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by taking care of them. For that we have a care centre and, other additional institutions. We also make environmental protection centers where people can visit and learn about this. To sum up, our village is very focussed on taking care of the natural world that surrounds us.

Transport pollution is one of the most dangerous.
On the one hand, that quantity of cars can't be forbidden, because it's a personal right to have one or not.
Also, another improving measure might be increasing green areas in cities and towns.
Factories damage nearby areas and water extremely badly.
In my opinion, firstly, new buildings on the banks must be forbidden at all.

Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon of farmland, forest and wetland disappearing because of some long-term human activities, for instance housing and transport networks are built, destroying the balance of the environment.
Firstly, it is clear that more houses and transport networks are convenient for our people. What is known to us is that the population growth is a big problem which creates a need for more space for living in.
And building more transport networks is also a benefit for us, for example, the high-speed rail can shorten the time spent on traveling, while the animals may not welcome it.

If public transport were of higher quality, faster and with lower fares, the majority of citizens would prefer it: it is calmer to relax and read a newspaper or a magazine during the journey on mass transport than in individual transport; moreover, the time spent to go and come back would be reduced, because it promotes fewer carriages on the railway.

Public transport is also used by children like me who want to go to school, high school or to university.

Once in a while, I enjoy watching tennis when there is a competition or tournament, besides watching and enjoying it, I can also learn how real the game is, what its rules were or what happens when they yell at the umpire for no reason.

THE STRENGTH OF SPECIAL EFFECTS

Parkour is a discipline in which the main purpose is to train your body and mind to be able to pass through a point A to point B, in any kind of environment, the safest and fastest way, without causing any harm to your body.
Parkour was developed in Lisses, France, around the 1980's.
One of the foundations used to develop Parkour was the Natural Method, created by Georges Hébert.
Basically, the method is based on developing the main foundations of movement of the human body. These are: swim, run, walk, jump, quadruped movement, climb, lift things, balance and defend yourself.
Raimond Belle was a former Vietnam soldier and worked as a fireman in the French army.
The roots of Parkour were developed by him and he taught some Parkour techniques to the firemen who he used to work with.
His son, David Belle, was taught some of the foundations of Parkour too.
Some people say that David created Parkour but, in fact, his father developed all the ideas of the discipline.
Parkour isn't just a physical discipline, there is also the philosophical part. Altruism, "be strong to be useful" (it is actually a phrase from the Natural Method), develop your body and mind so that, in a dangerous situation, you will be able to save yourself and other people, and so on.
Therefore, it is due to its philosophy and the joy that I feel before, during and after a training session, that Parkour is my favorite sport.

Sometimes it happens that journalists write some silly gossip about famous people which is not true.
Although it doesn't mean that the press should write about your private life.

Besides, being followed by unknown people must be quite a scary experience.

This could be good, although some people say we don't need all this time and we have to work more.
Another point is that we can meet friends more or visit our family if we have more free time and that is always good.

Famous people have always been surrounded by a lot of journalists and paparazzi who follow them wherever they go.

Personal contact shows a decrease in this time, because people don't want to face their real problems. Instead, they can see all the problems happening in the world on their smartphones.
In the future, people will communicate via their computers, cellphones, and tablets, and this kind of technology will lead us to a lonely life.

My name is Pawarit Chonlahat and I have lived in Bangkaen district since 2010.I found that this area has changed so rapidly, such as, now it has a lot of condominiums a long the main road and nowadays this area has a big shopping mall and a modern hospital and a large police station. That makes my life so convenient and safe because I can walk from my house to go to the shopping mall in about 10 minutes and I can walk to the hospital in just about 5 minutes, so I didn't worry when I got sick and the large police station is located in front of the hospital.

So, in my opinion, this area should have an improved transportation infrastructure like investment in Sky train system to cover this area.

So the real occupants of the house are Nicholas, an easily scared boy, his sister Anne, who turns out to be one of the most important characters in the film, and their mother, who is called Grace and has a particular obsession with catholisism.
The film describes how the love that a mother can give to her children can easily turn into an obsession. However, what makes this film so special is that it pretends to be a typical horror movie, but in its final scene, there is a sudden change which makes it more interesting.
I would recommend this film to anyone, even those who are easily scared, because it is not like the rest of the horror movies. It is a film in which you are continuously discovering secrets as if you were another character.
So it is a question that requires deeper reflection from all of us.
Whether public transport might be the solution, or be more suitable or not is something with arguments in its favour and against it.

Although on some occasions some clothes styles are required, people should have the freedom to choose what clothes they want to wear, and it should not have consequences in our lives.
In countries like Mexico, some people have the opportunity to use Uber, which is a service that you can use if you have a credit card. It is an amazing service, but not all the population have a car or the financial status to use an Uber, so people have to use public transportation, no matter if the bus or cab driver yells at them or drives badly. In Mexico, the public transportation, in particular the cabs, are not a very secure services, because some of the drivers steal and kidnap, in many situations they could kill you if you do not take precautions. But despite this, it is very sad that in that place people cannot do some things because they do not have the possibilities to pay for something more, so they have to take public transport.

I think there are things you need to plan because it's important for your life, but it depends on the situation, because I also like to let things be and let them happen because they have to happen, so the majority of the time I prefer not to think about it and just let them happen and not to plan anything.

On the other hand, it is possible to find hybrid cars, but they are more expensive than those that work with normal fuel and, for that reason, this kind of car is not people's first choice.

However, "Sebu" leads with a purchase price of $ 1,000.

Many people today have pets of all kinds.
First of all, a pet is a friend for the family and, much better, is a member of the family.
One more advantage of owning a pet is that it helps children learn to be responsible and caring.
On the other hand, there are a lot of disadvantages to owning a pet in big cities.
Pets and animals in general need fresh air and exercise outside and not to be always in an apartment.
I have heard about pets that get sick through living in a small apartment in town, and that is terrible.
In my opinion, it might seem good to have a pet if we take care of it.
All in all, owning a pet in a big city must be done carefully, ensuring all that the pet needs.
In the class, you should take notes and write down what is important. If you have any questions, then you should ask teachers to help.

I do not agree with the idea that there is no future for public transport, because it is a perfect means of transport for commuters and, nowadays, a lot of people are conscious of global warming and the environment, and refuse to use the car every day.
There are a lot of benefits to public transport. First, you don't have to drive yourself, you can listen to music, read a book or whatever you want without having to pay attention to the traffic. It is true, too, that travelling on this mode of transport helps the government because you have to pay for it, and the majority of modes of transport are cheap enough for everyone.
However, so many people love having their own vehicle, a car, a bike, a motto, because this give you other kind of freedom, you chose the way, you chose the time, you chose the way in you drive it, the positive thing about this kind of vehicle is that you don't have to take a bus, for example, crowded with people, you can go alone in your car, or with whoever you want, but the important thing is that you choose.
In conclusion, we can say that every kind of transport has its own pros and cons, but in my opinion, the difference between both of these is that in the second you choose your own way.

Surprisingly, when you are playing this sport you improve your speed and coordination too, so that could be an interesting reason for taking it up if you are not involved in it.
Personally, what I can say is that playing this sport makes me feel really alive and not only when I am playing it, it also happens when I am watching it, especially during the World Cup.

One of the measures that we, as world citizens, can take is to leave our cars at home and start to take public transport or to share cars with others.
This is causing diseases and allergies that are affecting the citizens.
Engineers are studying new engines that are more environmentally friendly, but even so, we have to reduce vehicles to help reduce the greenhouse effect and pollution.
Plans and programmes are being developed to reduce the number of cars driving through cities.

Once I visited a museum to find some pictures of cave painting in France, but when I went to France to see the real painting, I found it was more vivid and could show you how great the French cavemen who painted it were.

Michael grabbed his coat and crept out of his house in order not to wake up his parents.
He remembered that he still hadn't studied for his chemistry test.
If we think about it, the car is better because we don't need to wait for it like we wait for the bus or underground, but on the other hand, cars cost more money than public transport.
In a car, we can just be by ourselves, which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unknown, but if we choose public transport, we can meet friends or family, so both modes of transport are good, and cars don't need necessarily to bring an end to public transport.
But, even if it's true that it's the fastest option, you must be very careful when it's time to get off a plane.
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation, obviously, you have to take a boat.
There isn't any comparison with watching the changes in the landscape through a window, enjoying the route that you are taking and, the best part, the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days.
I went to the abandoned house and started to think of the best way to make his life miserable. I spent the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him suffer.
As I didn't find anything, I went to the place where he lived and started to look for some information about his life and find people who he cared about. So as I continued to go to his house, I noticed he would always go to the same house, s I decided to follow him to the house and I found out he was dating a girl. She might be his girlfriend, so I finally got an idea. I would drive him crazy just as he did me. That way she would think he had problems with his mind and leave him. But soon i thought about it again and realized that if I did that she would try to help him and they will be more united, so I decided to drive them both crazy, almost to the brink of death, just as he did with me!
I screamed. My anger had dominated my mind. I didn't have any control over my actions. I was afraid of what I had become and what I could do, but I could not control myself and the only thing I could think of was him suffering a slow death and the satisfaction I would feel when I finally had my revenge. The best revenge.
But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible, and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and greater. I had made a decision and I was going to do it. If he dedicated 4 years of his life to torturing me and not wanting me to be happy, the time is necessary for him to have a miserable life and I won't stop until I have accomplished my goal.
I graduated from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.
I am interested in looking after children and playing with children.

I'm learning a lot and the students are very friendly.
But I need to study harder because I want to pass the exam, and it's very difficult.
Technology has changed people's lives a lot. In fact, we can think how different our life is compared to either our parents 'or our grandparents' lives. For example, my parents didn't watch TV, because there wasn't any TV in the world when they were young. But that isn't the only difference: we can think about the mobile phone, the computer and finally the internet. Our grandparents couldn't have imagined a strange machine like the computer in their lives.
So the best way for them to travel is public transport.
Each person should practice saving energy when using any source of energy to protect his own life.
In conclusion, investments in developing public transport will be increased considerably. Public transport services have a bright future and their existence in the future can't be replaced.

Apart from educational content, there is so much bad content, business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens won't be able to tell right from wrong.
First of all, you need to be able to afford to buy it. After that, you must pay for the insurance, road tax, and mechanic's bills, and so on.
On the other hand, with public transport, you only have to pay for the ticket, you don't have to drive, and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use breaks down, it isn't your responsibility.

First, I agree with the given statement that there will be a tough time for public transportation in the near future, because people want privacy as well as freedom, which is quite impossible on public transportation.
as much as possible of the city or town which mismanaged routine for people who travel by public transportation. As a consequence, generally, people avoid travelling by public transportation. Finally, I can say that there are various modes of transportation available
which play an important role in giving tough competition to the government. As a result of this, the consumer gets more benefits, like lower fairs, privacy, freedom and safe travelling. In addition, many automobile companies launch new cars at affordable prices, which encourages people to use more and more private vehicles.

After spending a long time writing and doing a good job, he went to give his story to the international student magazine office. He found out there was a notice on the door saying that the competition was canceled. He came back very sad and told me what had happened. Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.
The vandalism in Patras has increased a lot.

Secondly, such a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves out in new professional spheres.
Also, they would have an opportunity to be involved in volunteer work.
This year-long holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting new energy for further education.
I believe that there is no future for public transport, using trains is more convenient and less expensive, so to decrease the carbon gases which are affecting the ozone layer, people should be aware of the effect of using public transportation on the economy and environment. Governments should encourage people to use other modes of transport. This subject should be issuesd in all media to teach and encourage people to use the right mode of transport.
Because if we are Chinese, why do we give up our mother tongue and learn about our own culture through a foreign language?
Woolypools is a specialist of meal, it's a meal restaurant.
With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of populations, a lot of agricultural land, forest and ocean has been used or destroyed to build more buildings and transport networks.
To start with, there are a wide range of problems it may lead to.
Additionally, people now continue to destroy more agricultural land and forest in order to satisfy all their needs, which will destroy the ecosystem, diversity and biodiversity, especially the endangered species.
In light of the problems mentioned above, there are various approaches that governments should adopt to deal with this problem. First of all, reducing building construction from now on, and planting more trees instead.
Sustainable development should be awaness to all human beings and start to protect the environment and preserve the animals.
To sum up, this unpleasant phenomenon and its problems should be worked on to resolve them before things get worse, and the governments have to take the responsibility for that.
I took that decision because I was tired of trying to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted, so when I heard about that opportunity, I said yes.
I want to say something about learning the English language. It is hard for me for the following reasons:
First reason: the grammar that teachers or institutes teach is like the Spanish language, my native language.
I want to say that it is very difficult to understand the conjugation of the verbs in Spanish, so just imagine the same but not in your native language.
Second reason: in English syntax, the rules for constructing paragraphs or sentences, the verb is written before the subject, but not always. What is the rule?
I can recommend you to my uncle's company to get a job.

Even if it happens, there are many people who can't get a car, because it is too expensive, not only to buy, but for fuel, service and so forth.
Whether tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on our lives, it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorants.
Alongside its development, the ability to travel has become easier to such an extent that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.
The existence of multinationals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism, as well as to the idea of globalisation, since a traveller is not just a citizen of his own country, but a global citizen.
There are countries, such as Greece or Bulgaria, in which the economy relies completely on tourism.
If tourism influences the economy, it thereby influences the environment, and if it influences the environment, it influences transport. How? people become more careful at their historical sites, thereby preserving them. Transport is developed both on a small and a large scale.
On a small scale, in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficiently.

No future for a public transport? Is this claim true or not?
I think that it all depends on the development.
Yes, I agree, if you planned the journey for a faraway destination and for a long time you would prefer to do it by car, because, firstly, you'll spend less time, your journey will be comfortable, you'll have the possibility to stop any where and for a long time, as you need to.
But if we are talking about travelling across your city, would you prefer public transport or car?
I think that this is the question for everyone, and there can't be one answer for all, because one person can use public transport, and save in this way not only money, but the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t. because they spend more time travelling or they simply don't like to travel with other people.
guide people and give them information, details and guidelines about pollution.
I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant. It's name is "Lemon". I go there every week. It has different food to other restaurants. I like crispy chicken with garlic sauce. It's an excellent choice for me. And my favorite appetizer is sausage and in order that dessert I like "Vadge" cake with chocolate sauce. I feel at ease when I go there. I enjoy classical music while having lunch. About the service: it's very good and all the staff are respectable. I can't imagine one week without going there. That would drive me nuts. I advise everyone to go there and enjoy their time there. Also, this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really. It's excellent. The striking thing for anyone, is that despite all of these advantages, the prices are not expensive.
Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I am playing with my team, I am in another world in which I can be free and happy. Apart from this, when I am feeling bad, this is a distraction from university.
You should try playing, it's such fun, but I warn you, it is not easy at first, but you have to try many times like you should doin life.

Designing the bank notes is the first and indispensable step.
People should decide the background colour and the artwork and they have to consider the security issues.
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged but still good sheets, people will cut them into separate notes and pack them together in order to dispatch and distribute the bank notes.
If the partially damaged sheets are bad, they will be treated as bad sheets, which will be securely destroyed.

We live in a cottage and we have several bins which are classified according to the material we want to recycle.

Dear Sir or Madam,

Swimming as a sport is very useful for weight reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your weight. It is also the best sport for asthmatic patients, because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections.
I saw so many interesting things during the preparation time.
Regarding advertising, technology is having a huge and not always positive impact on outdoor advertising.
It will suit me sometimes, and it will even be useful, but I'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggressive.
The way it feels aggressive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens, no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are.
But, technology is here for better or worse, and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can.
I'd like to have a big detached house in the suburbs of Artem or Vladivostok.
If I had this house, I would decorate it in a modern style.
It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment, where and with who, to watch this or that television program.
Actually, students eat a lot of fast food while they are studying at university, because they don't have time to cook food. For these reasons, I think that the best restaurant is somewhere where they do home-made food, and a good idea for the main course is: baked potatoes, steamed vegetables and, for dessert, apple cake.
They are incredibly delicious.

Soccer is a great sport where you can make a lot of friends, you can stay fit, but you also need some skills because it's not easy to control the ball and dribble your rivals on the field.
I know that catching a celebrity doing cleaning or taking a dog for a walk is shocking news for people who read tabloids.
So, as you can see, I agree with the statement that famous people, who are recognizable, deserve to have a private life and the ability to have a normal life should also be given to them.

The importance of working hard to achieve goals and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen.
For instance, if my goal was to increase young people's awareness, some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for siblings.
The last step would be to recruit a staff of professional, experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide.
Undertaking a scholarship and admission to one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school in a business setting, as well as develop the communication, organisation and numeracy skills I acquired at high school.

This movie touched me very deeply, it made me think about life and about the way people usually live without appreciating the really important things.
It is a cyclical process.
Rome had its heyday in the first century AD, but just three centuries later, it was only a shadow of its past.
One day in the future, another Franz Ferdinand could be killed, and that symbolic event could serve again as an excuse for some country to declare war on another, but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have their roots in much older times.
As the causes of the Second World War had its roots in events that were the outcome of the First War, a Third, hypothetical war, could have its roots in a past conflict that may well have happened already.
During the next centuries it was expanded, and in the 16th century, finally rebuilt in a Renaissance style, which has remained unchanged until today-the most representative remnant is probably the famous arcaded courtyard.
During the tour, the visitors are shown several rooms and apartments, as well as the Royal Private Apartments with world-famous tapestries of the Polish kings 'collection.
Everybody say it's the best period in our whole life; what they don't remember is that it can also be the worst.
This could be one of the reasons why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents: every time we discover something new or we say something, they judge us or they begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas.
As I said, adolescents can be very confused and if there's one thing that gets under our skin, it is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite.
That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of; the type of love that doesn't let us fall asleep at night.
Travelling by car is also much more convenient.
In conclusion we can say that, from the standpoint of doctors and nurses, working abroad is a much better deal.
Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underground dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people. The new boxers could be even more at risk.
There are all sorts of proposals; lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn, ban punches to the head, headguards worn, or make fights shorter, as most of the serious injuries occur in the later rounds. These would all show off the boxers 'skill and talent and still be entertaining to watch.
However, such a rebellion cannot be seen clearly in each minority work, and, therefore, the products of ethnic American literature cannot be categorized as merely the result of years of oppression.
Emphasis changes with each work, and although figures of authority are particularly oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple, other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters 'responsive action which the previously mentioned works show.
This again implies that these ethnic American pieces of literature cannot be categorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression, but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences.
Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and any occurrence is for some good.
The supremacy of Parliament will never be challenged.
But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully integrated with Europe.
In fact, in political, economic and defence terms, I feel this reallocation of resources can and will be very positive.
Whilst, to a certain extent, I may be guilty of having an island mentality, I wouldn't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless bureaucrats in Brussels or Strasbourg.
This process will continue and Europe and the rest of the world will evolve with or without the participation of Britain in this process.
In relinquishing and thus centralising certain powers, the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage.
It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerance.
These superpowers were economically, militarily and politically stronger than the divided individual European states.
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is successful depends very much on the people of Europe.
To remedy this, the government has started adding a fourth lane on some stretches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception.
The inability to cope with the amount of traffic on the part of the road system obviously increases the risk of drivers having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic.
It might seem an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e. the railways.
People are not taking to the rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privatisation of different areas.
Then people would be more likely to catch the train, as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk, wait for a bus or pay for an expensive taxi ride.
My solution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services. This would get people off the roads and onto the trains.
To improve the rail service, trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times, i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six.
The train and bus companies have to liaise with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap, i.e. the same price as or less than it would cost to go by car.
The basic dilemma facing the UK's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population.
Most large cities have managed to encourage commuters to use public transport, thus decreasing major congestion in rush hour periods.
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicular transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere, damaging the ozone layer, creating smog and forming acid rain. Torturing the Earth we are living on.
To illustrate my point, if every time you took a train, it stopped for 2 hours on the track, everyone would stop taking it.
The most likely answer lies in 2 areas. Firstly, the attitude of many westerners is that it is their right to travel in such a manner.
I am by far and away no 'greeny' who wants to make everyone live in teepee s and eat soya bean soup. However, I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today.
Do we, the western world (5% of the population of the world), have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at this environmental cost?
Just because we cannot be bothered to get out of bed a bit earlier to catch public transport.
That could have disastrous implications.
The 2nd reason, is the problem that the public transport service, for example rail, is declining so much; there is no train to catch in the morning.
This has now been intensified with the sale of the railways to private rail companies, profit motivated.
The vital, small rail links may now be closed, whereas previously they where subsidised to make up the loss. Now the private companies cannot afford to do this, so many will close, cutting off small towns and villages.
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it, and the only people to do this is the government or ourselves. If we make the effort to use public transport, it will expand into a good service. Unfortunately, the public seem to be apathetic towards this idea.
Although it may sound cruel, I do not believe that any fighter has entered a professional boxing career without knowing the risks.
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the 'sport' safer: having ringside doctors, banning bare hand fights, but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage.
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport, and the controversy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again at the forefront of discussion.
The family, who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport, would be leading the protests against boxing.
This hypocritical view is shared by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the foreseeable future.
The lottery has also suffered allegations that it is addictive, especially with the introduction of scratch cards.
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their available cash on lottery tickets, only to be disappointed.
It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound received by the lottery goes to charitable causes. The rest is tax the prize fund, profits, and the so-called charities.
It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions, i.e. highly unlikely.
It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high. Most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot had ruined their life, alienating them from friends and family.
In conclusion, I think that the lottery should be retained, but not in its present form. I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds, and the prize fund shared between more people: it is better to give fourteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person.
I would also remove any American business interests and give the charity money to a more deserving 'charity'.
The most obvious example of this is the calculator, an instrument used by mathematicians and scientists for making numerical calculations.
The world watched in anticipation. We were mesmerized by the images of the TV, expecting something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it. I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school: "Have you heard?", "I can't believe it!", "After all this time!", "I never thought it would happen.
Bolstered by the Germans 'success, the people of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Rumania rose against communist regimes as well. Now, three years later, communism as we once knew it no longer exists.
The repetition of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and, not only that, it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again.
Whether it be a kitchen knife used to stab someone, a car used to run someone over, or something as harmless as a pillow used to suffocate.
Normally, more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccessful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy.
There are people who are against this, saying it is not natural and asking is it fair to the child to have started life in a test tube, as they believe life starts from the moment of conception.
, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundreds of lives by vaccinating people against measles, for example.
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations i.e.
People in our modern times are now able to have liver, heart and even lung transplants. There are many complications but many are successful.
The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the foetus is formed, and the baby is then inserted back into the mother.
The foetus is left to grow and develop naturally.
This idea is extremely beneficial because married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccessful are able to have children.
As the foetus begins its life in a test tube, and the sperm is selected, this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected.
The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSE.
This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consuming the animal.
Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism, although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point about BSE.
Although British farmers have learned to diversify, dairy farming and the sale of beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain.
People throughout the United Kingdom were, doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalopathy, or BSE.
For beef to be reprieved or condemned, we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked, and, more importantly, whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former.
This claim has devastated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness.
As you can imagine, this has had a tremendous influence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants, where beefburgers are the main item on the menu.
The answer to this question lies in one's feelings about Democracy.
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century, Women's Liberation has been met with adamant, and often obstinate opposition.
This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists, made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild, disgruntled zealots and was, therefore, detrimental to the good of society.
Like many other aspects and movements in life, they would be more readily received if the public it was being aimed at was not so jaded.
However, throughout the years, television has lost much of its integrity; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education.
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and difficulties.
Though it has probably been around for a while, it s presence hasn't really been known until fairly recently, and it s consequences have been devastating.
AIDS has definitely had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world, because it always leads to death and there is no cure.
As a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrations, the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana; from survival kits and basement bomb shelters to an ever-circulating Chief Executive command post from the air.
It was also attempted to increase the production of the naturally-occurring antibiotics through synthesis.
In part, it has created The Information Age, as the latter part of the 20th century is often labelled.
Presidents and dictators alike switch on the channel to receive first-hand information from the network, such as impeachments, coups d'etat or civil wars.
40% of U.S. millionaires are entertainers.
Unfortunately, the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversible.
The waters of the culinary seas had been calm and consistent for centuries.
Progress had moved slowly like the tides and the constant rhythm of the waves showed little change.
However, with the dawn of the twentieth century, a storm brewed.
In an age where time is the scarcest commodity, our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen.
This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzying pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century.
Every morning I listen for the weather forecast and dress accordingly.
TV commercials and TV programs project models of how one should be.
People are more mobile, can work more, and buy more things, but time for relaxation and family are often substituted with TV. In America, this growing individualistic society, one no longer sees the relative humanness between people, instead one sees the differences, the unlucky, the unsuccessful, and attribute their inability to achieve to a lack of effort.
There was a group of scholars in France, l'Academie Française, that set guidelines for French literature.
According to l'Academie Française, all literature of the Neoclassical period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics, including sex, violence, church, and state issues.
He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys, and of the Baron who bathed with the Muslim and was punished for his homosexual act.
After the Baron is caught bathing with the Muslim, he receives 100 lashes for his sin.
He attracts the hypocrisy of the Church in the old woman's father being the Pope.
Desegregation reduced some prejudice, but it still exists.
This is based on equity theory.
The opposite of love, beauty, intelligence, light, joy, life and growth are not their familiar antonyms but indifference.
When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through, we can sympathize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity.
The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victims are necessary to avoid indifference.

I don't understand why so many people are into this stuff. Anyway, I decided to arrange some nice dates for my friends by/ following my own style/ doing it my way.

Japanese marriage system
The bride and groom simply go toa registryoffice andcomplete the marriage application form, which has the bride's, the groom's, and two witness's signatures.
No picture IDs are required to complete the marriage application form.
Somebody else can go there instead of the couple.
Because of the system, problems sometimes arise.
When a couple go to the city office tocomplete their marriage form, they sometimes find out that one of them (or both of them) is already married to someone else.
